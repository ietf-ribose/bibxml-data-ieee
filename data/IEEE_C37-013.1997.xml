    <abstract>Ratings, performance requirements, and compliance test methods are provided for ac high-voltage generator circuit breakers rated on a symmetrical current basis that are installed between the generator and the transformer terminals. Guidance for applying generator circuit breakers is given. Pumped storage installations are considered a special application, and their requirements are not completely covered by this standard.</abstract>
