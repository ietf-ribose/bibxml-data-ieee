abstract:
  content: A unified access method that offers integrated services (IS) to the desktop
    for a variety of publicly and privately administered backbone networks (e.g.,
    ANSI FDDI, IEEE 802.x and ISDN) is defined. In addition, the interface at the
    MAC sublayer and the PHY Layer is specified.
