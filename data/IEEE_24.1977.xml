    <abstract>This standard covers electrical, dimensional, and related requirements for outdoor power class apparatus bushings which have basic impulse insulation levels of 110 kV and higher. It provides specific values for dimensional and related requirements which are to be interpreted, measured, or tested in accordance with IEEE Std 21-1976, IEEE General Requirements and Test Procedure for Outdoor Apparatus Bushings (ANSI C76.1-1976). Bushings covered by this standard are intended for use as components of oil-filled transformers, oil-filled reactors, and oil circuit breakers.</abstract>
