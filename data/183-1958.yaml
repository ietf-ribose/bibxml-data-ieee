abstract:
  content: The standardisation of methods of testing radio telegraph transmitters
    is considered. The classification of tests to be performed is discussed, and specific
    methods of measuring power output, spurious transmitter output, frequency stability,
    carrier hum, and keying characteristics are given.<<ETX>>
