    <abstract>Design and operational criteria are provided for the performance of periodic testing as part of the surveillance program of nuclear power generating station safety systems. Such testing consists of functional tests and checks, calibration verification, and time-response measurements, as required, to verify that the safety system performs to meet its defined safety function. The system status, associated system documentation, test intervals, and test procedures during operation are also addressed.</abstract>
