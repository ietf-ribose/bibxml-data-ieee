    <abstract>This guide provides general recommendations for performing maintenance work on energized power-lines. It is not intended to include all of the proven, practical methods and procedures; however, these selected comprehensive recommendations are based on sound engineering principles, engineering safety considerations, and decades of field experience by many utilities. Included are technical explanations as required to cover: certain laboratory testing of tools and equipment; field maintenance and care of tools and equipment; work methods for the maintenance of energized lines and for persons working in the vicinity of energized lines.</abstract>
