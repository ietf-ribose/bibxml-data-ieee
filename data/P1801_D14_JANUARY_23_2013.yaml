abstract:
  content: A method is provided for specifying power intent for an electronic design,
    for use in verification of the structure and behavior of the design in the context
    of a given power management architecture, and for driving implementation of that
    power management architecture. The method supports incremental refinement of power
    intent specifications required for IP-based design flows.
