abstract:
  content: This standard describes requirements for power line carrier (PLC) transmitter/receiver
    equipment used to transfer discrete teleprotection signals at power line carrier
    frequencies (30-500 kHz). Test requirements and conditions for determining performance,
    as well as manufacturing requirements, are defined.
