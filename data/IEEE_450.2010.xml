    <abstract>Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage batteries used for standby service are provided. This recommended practice also provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. This recommended practice is applicable to standby service stationary applications where a charger maintains the battery fully charged and supplies the dc loads.</abstract>
