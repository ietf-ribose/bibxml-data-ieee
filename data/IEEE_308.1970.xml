    <abstract>This Standard presents criteria and requirements for the electric systems of nuclear generating stations specifically related to providing protection to the health and safety of the public. These are based on the following.(a) Redundant systems that require electric power are provided to cope with design basis events.(b) The conditions and the availability of the various portions of the systems following a design basis event cannot be predicted exactly.(c) The access to certain equipment following a design basis event may be limited for several months.</abstract>
