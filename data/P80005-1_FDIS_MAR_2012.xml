  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This international standard (standard) describes HVSC systems, on board the ship and on shore, to supply the ship with electrical power from shore. This standard is applicable to the design, installation and testing of HVSC systems and addresses: * HV shore distribution system, * shore-to-ship connection and interface equipment, * transformers/reactors, * semiconductor / rotating convertors, * ship distribution system, and * control, monitoring, interlocking and power management system. This standard does not apply to the electrical power supply during docking periods, e.g. dry docking and other out of service maintenance and repair. NOTE 1 Additional and/or alternative requirements may be imposed by the National Administration or Authorities within whose jurisdiction the ship is intended to operate and/or by the Owners or Authorities responsible for a shore supply or distribution system. NOTE 2 It is expected that HVSC systems will have practicable applications for ships requiring 1 MW or more or ships with HV main supply. NOTE 3 Low-voltage shore connection systems are not covered by this standard.</abstract>
