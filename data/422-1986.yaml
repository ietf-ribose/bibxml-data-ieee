abstract:
- content: This guide provides guidance and recommended practices on the installation
    and maintenance of liquid-immersed power transformers rated 501 kVA and above
    with secondary voltages of 1000 V and above. This guide covers the entire range
    of power transformers, including extra high-voltage (EHV) transformers. This guide
    does not cover special transformers such as furnace transformers, rectifier transformers,
    etc. Distinctions are made as required for various MVA ratings, voltage ratings,
    and types of liquid insulation.

- content: This document has been developed as a guide for the design and installation
    of wire and cable systems in generating stations with the objective of minimizing
    failures and their consequences. It applies to both nuclear and nonnuclear electric
    power generating stations. It covers cable performance, size and voltage rating,
    electrical segregation, separation of redundant systems, shielding and shield
    grounding. Cable penetration fire stops, fire detection and extinguishing systems,
    cable installation, acceptance tests and raceways are also covered.<<ETX>>
