    <abstract>Security categorization is the first step in a security risk management framework because of its impact on all other steps, from selection of security controls to apply based upon the assessment to the level of effort required to assess the effectiveness of the security controls put in place. Security categorization covers information (data) at rest and information systems. The approach used in this guide applies only to data at rest. The approach aligns National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-60 Volume 1, revision 1 [B2] and with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) FIPS 199 [B1], the latter of which establishes security categories based on the magnitude of harm expected to result from compromises rather than on the results of an assessment that includes an attempt to determine the probability of compromise.</abstract>
