    <abstract>This standard is intended for use as a basis for determining performance, interchangeability, andsafety of the equipment covered, and to assist in the proper selection of such equipment.This standard covers certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics and takesinto consideration certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz., mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, padmounted,compartmental-type distribution transformers with high-voltage bushings. These transformers are rated 2500 kVA and smaller, with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 volts and below, and with low voltages of 480 volts and below. These transformers are generally used for step-down purposes from an underground primary cable supply.</abstract>
