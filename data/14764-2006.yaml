abstract:
  content: This International Standard describes in greater detail management of the
    Maintenance Process described in ISO/IEC 12207, including Amendments. This International
    Standard also establishes definitions for the various types of maintenance. This
    International Standard provides guidance that applies to planning, execution and
    control, review and evaluation, and closure of the Maintenance Process. The scope
    of this International Standard includes maintenance for multiple software products
    with the same maintenance resources. “Maintenance” in this International Standard
    means software maintenance unless otherwise stated.
