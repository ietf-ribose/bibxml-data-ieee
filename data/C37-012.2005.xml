    <abstract>Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers for capacitance current switching is provided. The document addresses the general theory of capacitance current switching, the notion of restrike, reignition, NSDD and voltage factors are explained. Application of circuit breakers for different network conditions and different capacitive loads (lines, cables, capacitor and filter banks) is treated.</abstract>
