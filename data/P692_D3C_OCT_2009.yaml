abstract:
  content: Criteria are provided for the design of an integrated security system for
    nuclear power generating stations. Requirements are included for the overall system,
    interfaces, subsystems, and individual electrical and electronic equipment. This
    standard addresses equipment for security-related detection, surveillance, access
    control, communication, data acquisition, and threat assessment.
