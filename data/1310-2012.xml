  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This procedure is intended for form-wound bars/coils for rotating machines rated 10 kV or more at 50 Hz or 60 Hz that are subjected to many transitions from no-load to full-load current during normal operations, and where rapid load variations are typical. Only the thermal cyclic degradation within the groundwall insulation and/or the conductor package and delamination of the groundwall insulation from the conductor are addressed by this test. The procedure is applicable to indirectly-cooled machine types such as: (1) combustion turbine generators (2) pumped storage or peaking duty hydrogenerators (3) synchronous condensers (4) cyclic duty water pump motors. Various pass/fail criteria are presented, and the ones that apply in a specific circumstance must be agreed between user and manufacturer prior to commencement of testing.</abstract>
