abstract:
  content: This document describes the recommended procedure for measuring insulation
    resis-tance of armature and field windings in rotating machines rated 1 hp, 750
    W or greater. It applies to synchronous machines, induction machines, dc machines,
    and synchronous condensers. Con-tained within this document is the general theory
    of insulation resistance (IR) and polarization index (P.I.), as well as factors
    affecting the results, test procedures, methods of interpretation, test limita-tions,
    and recommended minimum values.
