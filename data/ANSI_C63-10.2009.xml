    <abstract>This standard is intended to cover procedures for testing the compliance of a wide variety of unlicensed wireless devices (also called unlicensed intentional radiators) including but not limited to: remote control and security unlicensed wireless devices, frequency hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum devices, anti-pilferage devices, cordless telephones, medical unlicensed wireless devices, Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure devices, intrusion detectors, unlicensed wireless devices operating on frequencies below 30 MHz, automatic vehicle identification systems, and other unlicensed wireless devices authorized by a radio regulatory authority. The test procedures for new technology wireless devices will be added to future editions of this standard as soon as practical after consensus is achieved for compliance testing methods of the new devices. However, this standard excludes test procedures for unlicensed wireless devices already covered in other published standards, e.g., Unlicensed Personal Communication Services (UPCS) devices.</abstract>
