    <abstract>Means of safeguarding personnel while operating or maintaining equipment located in electrolytic cell line working zones are provided. Included are related requirements for equipment and electrical conductor installations. The general types of electrolytic cells covered include, but are not limited to, the dc cells used in the production of aluminum, cadmium, chlorate, chlorine, copper, fluorine, hydrogen peroxide, magnesium, sodium, and zinc.</abstract>
