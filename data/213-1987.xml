    <abstract>Television and FM broadcast receivers are frequently potential sources of interference to other television and FM broadcast receivers and to receivers in other services. This standard defines a method for obtaining a measure of the emissions conducted by the power line from these potential interference sources in the frequency range of 300 kHz to 25 MHz. This standard describes standard input signals, the equipment setup, and measurement techniques. To perform the measurements described in this standard the following equipment is required: shielded room; a power line impedance stabilization network; (LISN); a source of a standard RF input signal; a tuned voltmeter; and a picture carrier intermediate frequency (IF) signal source (for television receivers only).&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
