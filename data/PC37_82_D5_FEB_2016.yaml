abstract:
  content: 'The methods and requirements for qualifying switchgear assemblies for
    indoor areas outside of the containment in nuclear power generating stations are
    described in this document. These assemblies include: metal-enclosed low-voltage
    power circuit breaker switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.1(TM);
    metal-clad switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.2(TM); metal-enclosed
    bus, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.23(TM); and metal-enclosed interrupter switchgear
    assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.3(TM).'
