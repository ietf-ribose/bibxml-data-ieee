    <abstract>A list of graphic symbols and class designation letters for use on electrical and electronics diagrams is provided. All of the symbols are designed so that their connection points fall on a modular grid, to help those who use a grid basis for the preparation of diagrams. A substantial effort has been made to make this standard compatible with approved International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Recommendations (IEC Publication 117, in various parts).</abstract>
