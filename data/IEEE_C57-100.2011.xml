    <abstract>A test procedure to provide a uniform method for investigating the effect of operating temperature on the life expectancy of liquid-immersed transformers is provided. The test procedures are intended to provide data for the selection of a limiting hottest-spot temperature for rating purposes, provide data which may serve as the basis for a guide for loading, and permit the comparative evaluation of a proposed insulation system with reference to a system that has proven to be acceptable in service.</abstract>
