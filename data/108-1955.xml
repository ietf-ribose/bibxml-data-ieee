    <abstract>The purpose of these specifications is to give a common basis of comparison among electronic voltmeters offered for generalpurpose applications. It is recommended that all manufacturers offering instruments for general applications supply the information outlined. For the purpose of these specifications, general-purpose voltmeters do not include instruments which are primarily intended for measurement of pulses or similar diseontinuous vaveforms, or instruments of the electrometer type which are designed to provide an extremely high input resistance (1010 ohms or more). It is recognized that a d d i t i o n a l information should be supplied with instruments in theseand other special groups which manufacturers should not be asked to supply when they are offering instruments for more genera1 applications.</abstract>
