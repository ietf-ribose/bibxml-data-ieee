abstract:
  content: IEEE C37.95-1989, IEEE Guide for Protective Relaying of Utility-Consumer
    Interconnections, is intended to cover applications involving service to a consumer
    that normally requires a transformation between the utility's supply voltage and
    the consumer's utilization voltage. Interconnections supplied at the ultimate
    utilization voltage are not covered.
