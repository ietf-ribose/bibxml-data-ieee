    <abstract>Information on the application, operation and maintenance of high-voltage fuses (above 1000 V and through 169 W), distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for use on ac distribution systems is provided. These include enclosed, open, and open-link types of distribution cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses; distribution enclosed single-pole air switches; power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor and indoor fuse disconnecting switches; fuse supports, mountings, and links, all of the type used exclusively with the above; and removable switch blades for certain products among the above</abstract>
