    <abstract>This document defines recommended practices for World Wide Web page engineering for Intranet and Extranet environments, based on World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and related industry guidelines. This recommended practice does not address stylistic considerations or human-factors considerations in Web page design beyond limitations that reflect good engineering practice. Annex B contains topics which are not sufficiently mature or where there are not specific recommendations for inclusion in the current issue of this recommended practice.</abstract>
