    <abstract>General considerations for grounding synchronous generator systems are summarized, focusing on the objectives of generator grounding. The factors to be considered in the selection of a grounding class and the application of grounding methods are discussed. Four generator grounding types are considered: unit-connected generation systems, common-bus generators without feeders, generators with feeders directly connected at generated voltage, and three-phase, 4-wire connected generators.</abstract>
