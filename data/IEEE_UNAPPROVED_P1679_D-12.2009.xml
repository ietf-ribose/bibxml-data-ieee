    <abstract>This document covers recommended information for an objective evaluation of an emerging energy storage technology device or system by a potential user for any stationary application. Energy storage technologies are those that provide a means for the reversible storage of electrical energy, i.e. the device receives electrical energy and is able to discharge electrical energy at a later time. The storage medium may be electrochemical (e.g. batteries), kinetic (e.g. flywheels), electrostatic (e.g. electric double-layer capacitors), thermal, or some other medium. Devices recharged by non-electrical means, such as fuel cells, are beyond the scope of this document.</abstract>
