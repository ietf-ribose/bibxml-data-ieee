    <abstract>This standard covers the design and operation of a dc microgrid for rural or remote applications based on extra low voltage dc to reduce cost and simplify stability. Such microgrids are typically operated without connecting to a nation's electric power system and are referred to as stand-alone microgrids.</abstract>
