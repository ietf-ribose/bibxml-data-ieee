    <abstract>Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 15, 2001. No longer endorsed by the IEEE. The mechanical design requirements for a military module, format E form factor are established. The specificaitons of dimensions and tolerances are intended to ensure the mechanical intermateability of military modules within associated subracks. Mechanical characteristics for military applications are also included.</abstract>
