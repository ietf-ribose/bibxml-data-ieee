    <abstract>Specification and test procedures for a single-axis interferometric fiber optic gyro (IFOG) for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. The test procedures are derived from those presently used in the industry.</abstract>
