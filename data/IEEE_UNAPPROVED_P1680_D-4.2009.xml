    <abstract>IEEE Std 1680-2008 provides guidance and implementation procedures for IEEE 1680 family of standards and defines the methods by which manufacturers may declare electronic products as conforming with the standards in the 1680 family of standards and by which such conformance may be verified. The standards within the family will provide clear and consistent performance criteria for the design of electronic products thereby providing an opportunity to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of electronic products. This family of standards is intended to provide a tool for government, institutional and corporate purchasers. Product manufacturers may also use this tool to earn recognition in the consumer market, recognizing that certain criteria may not be applicable to all types of purchasers.</abstract>
