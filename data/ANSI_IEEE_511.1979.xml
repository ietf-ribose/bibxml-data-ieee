    <abstract>This standard describes methods for measuring the linear waveform distortions of TV video signals, that is, distortions which are caused by amplitude-independent (linear) transmission characteristics of television equipment and facilities. The primary application of this standard is for routine operational and maintenance tests, where rapid interpretation of test results is desirable. The techniques described here may also be applicable to laboratory measurements, and detailed mainteance procedures.</abstract>
