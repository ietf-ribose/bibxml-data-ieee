    <abstract>The main emphasis of this recommended practice is the engineering design of optical fiber communication facilities serving, or connected to, electric supply locations. This recommended practice includes methods for providing telecommunication facilities serving electric supply locations using optical fiber cables, and their related electronic systems, extending across the zone of influence (ZOI).</abstract>
