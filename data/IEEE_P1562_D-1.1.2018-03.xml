    <abstract>Information to assist in sizing the array and battery of a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system is provided by this guide. Systems considered in this guide consist of PV as the only power source and a battery for energy storage. These systems also commonly employ controls to protect the battery from being over- or undercharged, and may employ a power conversion subsystem (inverter or converter). This guide is applicable to all stand-alone PV systems where PV is the only charging source. This guide does not include PV hybrid systems nor grid-connected systems. This guide covers lead-acid batteries only; nickel-cadmium and other battery types are not included. This guide does not include the sizing of the system controller, inverter, wiring, or other system components.</abstract>
