    <abstract>The enhanced security management function for the protocol defined in IEEE 1888(TM), Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network Protocol, is described in this standard. Securityrequirements, system security architecture definitions, and a standardized description of authentication and authorization, along with security procedures and protocols, are specified. This standard can help avoid unintended data disclosure to the public and unauthorized access to resources, while providing enhanced integrity and confidentiality of transmitted data in the ubiquitous green community control network.</abstract>
