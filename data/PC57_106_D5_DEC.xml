  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This guide applies to mineral oil used in transformers, load tap changers, voltage regulators, reactors, and circuit breakers. The guide discusses the following: a) Analytical tests and their significance for the evaluation of mineral insulating oil; b) The evaluation of new, unused mineral insulating oil before and after filling into equipment; c) Methods of handling and storage of mineral insulating oil; d) The evaluation of service-aged mineral insulating oil; e) Health and environmental care procedures for mineral insulating oil. The characteristics of the oils discussed in this guide does not include oil that is in factory fill lines, nor does this guide cover reclaimed oil installed in new equipment. The characteristics of the oils discussed in this guide does not include oil that is in factory fill lines, nor does this guide cover reclaimed oil installed in new equipment. The qualities of such oil, if used, should be agreed upon by the manufacturer and the user of the equipment.</abstract>
