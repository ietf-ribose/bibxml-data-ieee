    <abstract>A Secure Device Identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device and supports authentication of the device's identity. An Initial Device Identifier (IDevID) provided by the supplier of a device can be supplemented by Local Device Identifiers (LDevIDs) facilitating enrollment (provisioning of authentication and authorization credentials) by local network administrators.</abstract>
