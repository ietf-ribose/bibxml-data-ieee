    <abstract>This project will develop a guide for the planning, permitting, design, equipment specification, installation, commissioning, operation, and maintenance of gas insulated transmission lines. The guide will address technical aspects only. Commercial and legal issues associated with gas insulated transmission lines are not considered. This guide applies to AC transmission lines rated for maximum operating voltage of 72.5 kV and higher.</abstract>
