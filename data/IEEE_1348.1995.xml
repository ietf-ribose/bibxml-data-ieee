    <abstract>Difficulties that may be encountered, and how they can be avoided, by organizations intending to adopt CASE tools are addressed. An overview of the adoption process, including analysis of the organization's needs and readiness for automation, use of a pilot project, and definition of activities necessary to integrate the new technology into the organization's standard software engineering practice, is provided.</abstract>
