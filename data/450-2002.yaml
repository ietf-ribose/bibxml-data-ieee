abstract:
  content: Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to
    optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage
    batteries used for standby power applications are provided. This recommended practice
    also provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. This recommended
    practice is applicable to full-float stationary applications where a charger maintains
    the battery fully charged and supplies the dc loads.
