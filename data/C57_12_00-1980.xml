    <abstract>This standard is intended as a basis for the establishment of performance, limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and safety requirements of equipment described; and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment. This standard describes electrical, mechanical, and safety requirements of liquid-immersed distribution and power transformers, and autotransformers and regulating transformers; single and polyphase, with voltage 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding. This standard applies to all liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers except as indicated below: (1) Instrument transformers. (2) Step-voltage and induction voltage regulators. (3) Arc furnace transformers. (4) Rectifier transformers. (5) Specialty transformers. (6) Grounding transformers. (7) Mobile transformers. (8) Mine transformers. When this standard is used on a mandatory basis, the words shall and must indicates mandatory requirements; and the words should and may refer to matters which are recommended or permissive, but not mandatory.</abstract>
