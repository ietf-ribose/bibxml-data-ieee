    <abstract>Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are set forth as well as certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz, liquid-immersed, self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers. These transformers are rated 10 MVA and smaller, with the high-voltage limit of 34.5 kV nominal system voltage and below, and with low-voltage limit of 15 kV nominal system voltage and below. This standard covers the connector, bushing, and terminal arrangements for radial or loop feed systems. This standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer.</abstract>
