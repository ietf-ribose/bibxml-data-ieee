    <abstract>Approved Draft. This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access control layer(MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint broadbandwireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is structured to supportthe WirelessMAN-SC, WirelessMAN-OFDM, and WirelessMAN-OFDMA PHY specifications,each suited to a particular operational environment. The standard enables rapid worldwidedeployment of innovative, cost-effective, and interoperable multivendor broadband wirelessaccess products, facilitates competition in broadband access by providing alternatives towireline broadband access, encourages consistent worldwide spectrum allocation, andaccelerates the commercialization of broadband wireless access systems.</abstract>
