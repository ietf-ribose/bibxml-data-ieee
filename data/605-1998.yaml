abstract:
  content: Rigid-bus structures for outdoor and indoor, air insulated, and alternating
    current substations are covered. Portions of this guide are also applicable to
    strain bus structures or direct current substations, or both. Ampacity, radio
    influence, vibration, and forces due to gravity, wind, fault cur-rent, and thermal
    expansion are considered. Design criteria for conductor and insulator strength
    calculations are included.
