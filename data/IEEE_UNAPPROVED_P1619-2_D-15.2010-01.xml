    <abstract>This standard describes the EME2-AES and XCB-AES wide block encryption with associated data (EAD) modes of the NIST AES block cipher, providing usage guidelines and test vectors. A wide block encryption algorithm is one in which behaves as a single block cipher with a large plaintext input and ciphertext output, but uses a narrow block cipher (in this case AES) internally. These encryption modes are oriented towards random access storage devices that do not provide authentication, but need to reduce the granularity of a potential attack.</abstract>
