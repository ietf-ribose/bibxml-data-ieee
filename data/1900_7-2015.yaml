abstract:
  content: A radio interface including medium access control sublayer and physical
    layer of white space dynamic spectrum access radio systems supporting fixed and
    mobile operation in white space frequency bands, while avoiding causing harmful
    interference to incumbent users in these frequency bands is specified in this
    standard.
