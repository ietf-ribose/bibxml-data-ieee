    <abstract>Requirements for the design, construction, qualification, testing, and installation of electric penetration assemblies in nuclear containment structures for stationary nuclear power generating stations are presented. Quality control and quality assurance requirements, and requirements for purchaser's specification are included. The requirements for external circuits that connect to penetration assemblies and for operation, maintenance, or periodic testing after installation are not covered.</abstract>
