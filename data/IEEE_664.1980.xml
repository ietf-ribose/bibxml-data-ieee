    <abstract>Superseded by 664-1993. The current methodologies, including apparatus, procedures, and measurement accuracies, for determining the dynamic characteristics of vibration dampers and damping systems are described. Some basic guidance is provided regarding a given method’s strengths and weaknesses. The methodologies and procedures described are applicable to indoor testing only.</abstract>
