    <abstract>This amendment enhances the 802.20 Management Information Base (MIB) chapter to include additional information and MIB documentation (i.e, a discussion of Security impacts, and cross references to the text for appropriate parameters within the MIB, itself) to conform with the applicable parts of the IETF's 2008 guidelines for MIBs. The amendment also corrects any errors, inconsistencies and ambiguities associated with the MIB chapter of IEEE 802.20-2008.</abstract>
