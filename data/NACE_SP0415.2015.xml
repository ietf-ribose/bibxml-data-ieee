    <abstract>This NACE/IEEE joint standard provides requirements to (1) help electric utilities identify structures that may be at a high risk for below-grade corrosion; (2) excavate and inspect the selected structures; (3) categorize the condition of structures based on corrosion degradation; (4) prioritize structures requiring additional inspection based on those findings; and (5) help identify next steps as required. The standard is limited to the inspection and assessment of steel transmission towers, poles, and substation structures, to include galvanized, self-weathering, and painted mild steel structures, as well as other similar structures.</abstract>
