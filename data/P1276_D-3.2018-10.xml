    <abstract>Technical information is provided in this guide related to liquid-immersed power, distribution, and regulating transformers that are designed to operate at temperatures that exceed the normal thermal limits of IEEE Std C57.12.00(TM), under continuous load, in the designed average ambient and at rated conditions. Guidelines for applying high-temperature solid and liquid materials as insulation systems; guidelines for loading high-temperature liquid-immersed power, distribution, and regulating transformers; and guidelines on test procedures for qualifying new high-temperature solid and liquid insulating materials are included.</abstract>
