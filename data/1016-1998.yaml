  content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the family on Software Engineering.
    The necessary information content and recommendations for an organization for
    Software Design Descriptions (SDDs) are described. An SDD is a representation
    of a software system that is used as a medium for communicating software design
    information. This recommended practice is applicable to paper documents, automated
    databases, design description languages, or other means of description.
