abstract:
  content: The amendment will not include a separate Scope clause and the existing
    scope of IEEE 1188 will not change. The scope of the amendment is to remove the
    glossary annex and to export terms under the definition clause. The amendment
    will also introduce a new annex to cover capacity loss in VLRA batteries and will
    include some minor word changes to provide clarification to the user of the standard.
