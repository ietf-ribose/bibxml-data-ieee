    <abstract>Certain mechanical requirements relating to tank strength as well as static and dynamic tank pressure mitigation for liquid-immersed distribution transformers are covered in this standard. The electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer are not covered in this standard. It is intended to define the mechanical performance requirements to prevent permanent tank deformation or rupture of distribution transformers covered under this standard. These requirements will provide a more standard design of transformer tank and associated components related with both static and dynamic pressure coordination.</abstract>
