abstract:
  content: This guide provides a recommended table of contents for high-voltage circuit
    breaker instruction manuals. The guide provides a listing of information that
    will help a knowledgeable user receive, install, commission, operate, and maintain
    circuit breakers. Recommended additional material is described in Clause 5 for
    circuit breakers that are intended for high-voltage, free-standing installations.
    Drawout circuit breakers used in switchgear are excluded from Clause 5 requirements.
    Circuit breakers used in gas-insulated switchgear installations are excluded from
    this guide. This guide in no way replaces the manufacturerâ€™s instruction manual,
    which is to be used for safe and effective utilization of the circuit breaker.
    This guide helps organize instruction manual information in a consistent and user-friendly
    manner.
