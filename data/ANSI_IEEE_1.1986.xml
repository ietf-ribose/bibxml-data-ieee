    <abstract>Technical progress since 1969 revision of this standard has resulted in general agreement that a number of service stresses or factors, influence the life of electrical insulation, in materials tests and in systems used in electric equipment. While earlier editions of this standard made note of this fact, no guidance was provided to equipment committees who found a need to incorporate these additional factors into specific test guides.</abstract>
