    <abstract>Superseded by 929-2000. Recommendations and requirements that ensure operation of the terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) system that is compatible with the electric utility are provided. Factors relating to personnel safety, equipment protection, and power quality are addressed. The standard applies to utility-interconnected residential and interm ediate-size PV power systems capable of two-way energy flow with the utility. It addresses the interface between the PV system and the utility, and provides technical recommendations for the characteristics of the interface. Power quality, equipment protection, and safety of personnel are covered.</abstract>
