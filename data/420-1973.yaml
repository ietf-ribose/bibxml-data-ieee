abstract:
  content: This document applies to all Class 1E control switchboards (for example,
    main control room assemblies, auxiliary panels, local panels or racks, etc) as
    defined in Section 3, regardless of their application or location. It does not
    apply to the non-Class 1E control switchboards, except as they affect the Class
    1E control switchboards, but recognizes that Class 1E control switchboards may
    be adjacent to, or joined with, other non-Class 1E control switchboards. This
    document includes, but is not necessarily limited to, design, construction, wiring
    practices, shipping, handling, storage, installation, testing, and quality assurance.
    General design practices which are not unique to Class 1E control switchboards
    are not addressed in this document. This document applies to piping systems and
    Class 1E equipment only as they may affect the integrity of the Class lE control
    switchboard.
