    <abstract>Standard measurement and test procedures are established for wide-bandgap semiconductor detectors such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium-zinc-telluride (CdZnTe), and mercuric iodide (HgI2) that can be used at room temperature for the detection and quantitative characterization of gamma-rays, X-rays, and charged particles. Standard terminology and descriptions of the principal features of the detectors are included. Included in this standard is an annex on interfering electromagnetic noise, which is a factor in such measurements.</abstract>
