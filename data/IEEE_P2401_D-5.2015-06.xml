    <abstract>A method is provided for specifying a common interoperable format for electronic systems design. The format provides a common way to specify information/data about the project management, netlists, components, design rules, and geometries used in LSI-Package-Board designs. The method provides the ability for electronic systems as a key consideration early in the design process, the design tools can use to exchange information/data seamlessly.</abstract>
