  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This standard covers means of safeguarding personnel while operating or maintaining equipment located in electrolytic cell line working zones.Included are related requirements for equipment and electrical conductor installations. The general types of electrolytic cells covered include, but are not limited to, the dc cells used in the production of aluminum,cadmium,chlorate,chlorine,copper,fluorine,hydrogen peroxide, magnesium, sodium, and zinc. This standard does not cover the following: 1)Electroplating and anodizing facilities 2)AC cells or furnaces 3)Electrothermal process furnaces 4)Melting or heat treating facilities 5)Arc furnaces 6)Any electrical equipment that is neither part of the electrolytic process equipment nor installed or used in the cell line working zone.</abstract>
