    <abstract>Measurements of the electrical properties of naturally occurring solids are covered in the scope of this guide. Not covered are methods that rely on mapping earth structure anomalies unless directly related to electrical properties. Coverage of numerical methods for forward/inverse modeling is limited.</abstract>
