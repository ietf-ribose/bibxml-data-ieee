abstract:
  content: A secure device identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device,
    and supports authentication of the deviceÂ¿s identity. Locally significant identities
    can be securely associated with an initial manufacturer-provisioned DevID and
    used in provisioning and authentication protocols to allow a network administrator
    to establish the trustworthiness of a device and select appropriate policies for
    transmission and reception of data and control protocols to and from the device.
    This draft is an individual contribution to the Secure Device Identifier project,
    it has no official standing, and has not yet been reviewed or adopted by the task
    group.
