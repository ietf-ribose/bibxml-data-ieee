    <abstract>Recommendations and guidelines for managing natural disaster impact on key electrical facilities and systems in petroleum and chemical facilities are provided in order to minimize economic damage by pre-assessment risk evaluation of electrical facilities, by identification of mitigation techniques and system designs to minimize impact, and by outlining procedures for faster recovery of electrical systems after a natural disaster.</abstract>
