    <abstract>Guidelines for the definition of a reliability program at nuclear power generating stations are developed. Reliability programs during the operating phase of such stations are emphasized; however, the general approach applies to all phases of the nuclear power generating station life cycle (e.g., design, construction, start-up, operating, and decommissioning).</abstract>
