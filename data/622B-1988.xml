    <abstract>This IEEE recommended practice provides recommendations for the testing and start-up of electric heat tracing systems in power generating stations. The recommendations include the testing sequence of materials and components of the electric heat tracing system, installation, and pre-operational testing of the system, and verification of system performance.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
