abstract:
- content: The minimum required contents of a Software Configuration Management (SCM)
    Plan are established via this standard. This standard applies to the entire life
    cycle of critical software (e.g., where failure would impact safety or cause large
    financial or social losses). It also applies to noncritical software and to software
    already developed. The application of this standard is not restricted to any form,
    class, or type of software.
