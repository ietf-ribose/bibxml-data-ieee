abstract:
  content: This standard defines environmental performance criteria for computer servers
    as defined in the Energy Star Server specifications1, including managed servers
    and blade servers. This standard establishes criteria for multiple levels of environmental
    leadership and performance throughout the product life cycle, relating to reduction
    or elimination of environmentally sensitive materials, materials selection, design
    for end of life, lifecycle extension, energy conservation, end of life management,
    corporate responsibility, and packaging
