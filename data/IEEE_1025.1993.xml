    <abstract>Reaffirmed 2012. Good practice that will improve the ability to assemble and erect self-supporting and guyed concrete pole structures for overhead transmission lines is presented. Construction aspects after foundation installation and up to the conductor stringing operation are covered. Some aspects of construction related to other materials use in concrete pole structures are covered, but the treatment is not complete. The guide is intended to be used as a reference source for parties involved in the ownership, design, and construction of transmission structures</abstract>
