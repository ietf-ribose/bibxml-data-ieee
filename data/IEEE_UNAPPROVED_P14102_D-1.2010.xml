    <abstract>This International Standard deals with the evaluation and selection of CASE tools, covering a partial or full portion of the software engineering life cycle. It establishes processes and activities to be applied for the evaluation of CASE tools and selecting the most appropriate CASE tools from several candidates. These processes are generic, and organisations must tailor them to meet organisational needs. The CASE tool evaluation and selection processes should be viewed in the larger context of the organisation's technology adoption process.</abstract>
