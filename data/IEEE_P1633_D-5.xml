    <abstract>Software Reliability (SR) models have been evaluated  ranked for their applicability to various situations. The revision will reflect advances in SR since 1992, including modeling  prediction for distributed  network systems. Situation specific usage guidance will be refined  updated. The included methodology tools will be extended over the software life cycle.</abstract>
