    <abstract>Software Reliability (SR) models have been evaluated &amp; ranked for their applicability to various situations. The revision will reflect advances in SR since 1992, including modeling &amp; prediction for distributed &amp; network systems. Situation specific usage guidance will be refined &amp; updated. The included methodology tools will be extended over the software life cycle.</abstract>
