    <abstract>In February 2019 a Project Authorization Request was approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Association with the title “Standard for Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) Data and Metadata Content”. A Working Group was assembled to develop this standard with the purpose of unifying and documenting GNSS-R calibration procedures and product level definitions. The Working Group (https://sagroups.ieee.org/4003/) includes members, collaborators, and contributors from academia, international space agencies, and private industry. In a face-to-face meeting held during the ARSI+KEO 2019 Conference, the need was recognized to develop a standard with a wide range of operations, providing procedure guidelines independent of any constraints imposed by current limitations on geophysical parameter retrieval algorithms. As such, this effort aims to establish the fundamentals of a potential network of satellites providing inter-comparable data to the scientific community</abstract>
