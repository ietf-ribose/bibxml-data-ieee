abstract:
- content: Supplemental information for a high-speed serial bus that integrates well
    with most IEEE standard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses is specified. It is intended
    to extend the usefulness of a low-cost interconnect between external peripherals.
    This standard follows the IEEE Std 1212-2001 command and status register (CSR)
    architecture.
