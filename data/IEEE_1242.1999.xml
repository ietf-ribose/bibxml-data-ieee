    <abstract>Information on the specification and selection of power, control, and special-purposecable, as typically used in petroleum, chemical, and similar plants, is provided in this guide. Materials, design, testing, and applications are addressed. More recent developments, such as strandfilling, low-smoke, zero-halogen materials, and chemical-moisture barriers have been included.</abstract>
