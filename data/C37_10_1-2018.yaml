abstract:
  content: Direction is provided for the selection of monitoring and for diagnostic
    parameters to be used with high-voltage circuit breakers (i.e., above 1000 V).
    Guidance on appropriate parameters to be considered for monitoring applied to
    various circuit breaker technologies is also provided.
