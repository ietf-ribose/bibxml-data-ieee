    <abstract>Protocols, procedures, and managed objects for a Link-local Registration Protocol (LRP) to replicate a registration database from one end to the other of a point-to-point link and to replicate changes to parts of that database are specified in this standard. A facility is provided to purge the replicated database if the source becomes unresponsive. LRP is optimized for databases on the order of 1 Mbyte.</abstract>
