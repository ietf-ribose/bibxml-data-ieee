    <abstract>This standard describes methods for measuring ther performance of uniformly coded alnalog-to-digital (A/D) coverters and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters for pulse code modulation (PSM) television video signals. Excluded are A/D and D/A converters that employ nonlinear processes for bit reduction television circuits, as for example, sub-Nyquist encoding, differential PCM, transform coders, etc. This standard is intended primarily for CCIR System M, 525-line/60-field television circuits. The performance to be measured should be relevant to the subjective quality of the television picture. Measurements not related to the quality of the video signal are excluded from this standard. Where possible, television type test signals are used to accomodate clamping circuits in the converters.</abstract>
