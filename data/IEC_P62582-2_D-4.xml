    <abstract>This International Standard contains methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using the indenter modulus technique in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements for the selection of samples, the measurement system and measurement conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results.</abstract>
