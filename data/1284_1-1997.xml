    <abstract>A protocol and methodology for software developers, computer vendors and printer manufacturers to facilitate the orderly exchange of information between printers and host computers are defined in this standard. A minimum set of functions that permit meaningful data exchange is provided. Thus a foundation is established upon which compatible applications, computers and printers can be developed, without compromising an individual organization's desire for design innovation.</abstract>
