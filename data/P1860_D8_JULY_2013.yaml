abstract:
  content: This guide applies to voltage and reactive power control in 1000kV and
    above AC systems. It establishes criteria and requirements for electric power
    utilities in the planning, design, infrastructure, operation and scientific research
    of voltage or reactive power in 1000kV and above AC system, which should guarantee
    the system stability and equipments safety.
