    <abstract>Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Jan 10, 2002. No longer endorsed by the IEEE. This IEEE Standards product is part of the family on Software Engineering. Reference models for tool-to-organization interconnections, tool-to-platform interconnections, and information transfer among tools are provided. The purpose is to establish agreements for information transfer among tools in the contexts of human organization, a computer system platform, and a software development application. To make the transfer of semantic information among tools easier, asemantic transfer language (STL) is also provided. Interconnections that must be considered when buying, building, testing, or using computing system tools for specifying behavioral descriptions or requirements of system and software products are described.</abstract>
