abstract:
- content: This standard applies to premium efficiency, totally enclosed fan-cooled
    (TEFC), horizontal and vertical, single-speed, squirrel cage polyphase induction
    motors, up to and including 370 kW (500 hp), and 4000 V in National Electrical
    Manufacturers Association (NEMA) frame sizes 143T and larger, for petroleum, chemical,
    and other severe-duty applications (commonly referred to as premium-efficiency
    severe-duty motors). Excluded from the scope of this standard are motors with
    sleeve bearings and additional specific features required for explosion-proof
    motors.
