    <abstract>This document provides alternative approaches and good practices for the design, operation, and integration of distributed resource (DR) island systems with electric power systems (EPS). This includes the ability to separate from and reconnect to part of the area EPS while providing power to the islanded EPSs. This guide includes the distributed resources, interconnection systems, and participating electric power systems.</abstract>
