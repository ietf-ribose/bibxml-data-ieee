    <abstract>The selection and application of power distribution apparatus used in industrial andcommercial power systems are covered in this recommended practice. It is likely to be of greatestvalue to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience with this equipment. It can also bean aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial powersystems.</abstract>
