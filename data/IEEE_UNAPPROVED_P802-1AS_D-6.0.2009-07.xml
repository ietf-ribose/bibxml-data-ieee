    <abstract>This standard defines a protoocl and procedures for the transport of timing over Bridged and Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks. It includes the transport of synchronized time, the selection of the timing source (i.e., best master), and the indication of the occurrence and magnitude of timing impairments (i.e., phase and frequency discontinuities).</abstract>
