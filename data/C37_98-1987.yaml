abstract:
  content: This standard specifies the procedures to be used in the seismic testing
    of relays used in power system facilities. It is concerned with the determination
    of the seismic fragility level of relays and also gives recommendations for proof
    testing. The purpose is to establish procedures for determining the seismic capabilities
    of protective and auxiliary relays. These procedures employ what has been called
    fragility testing IEEE Std 344-1987.<<ETX>>
