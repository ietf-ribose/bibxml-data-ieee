    <abstract>Uniform criteria and guidelines for laboratory measurement and reporting of fly ash resistivity data obtained in the laboratory are presented. Fly ashes produced from the burning of any rank of coal are covered. Methods for ashing core bore samples of coal that have not been burned previously in a full-scale boiler are considered.</abstract>
