    <abstract>The basic electrical parameters to be met by silicon PN junction voltage clamping components used for the protection of telecommunications equipment or lines from surges are defined in this standard. It is intended that this standard be used for the harmonization of existing or future specifications issued by PN diode surge protective component manufacturers, telecommunication equipment manufacturers, administrations, or network operators.</abstract>
