    <abstract>This standard provides a set of application layer messaging services that are applicable for the enterprise and End Device ends of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). The application services include those useful for managing the AMI network assets defined by this standard. These messages may be transported over a wide range of underlying network transports such as TCP/IP, UDP, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.16, PLC and SMS over GSM, over a wide range of physical media. Additionally, interfaces are defined for a Communication Module and a Local Port (e.g. an IEEE 1701 optical port). The described protocol is tailored for, but not limited to, the transport of IEEE 1377 Table data. The standard also provides a means by which information can be sent in a secure manner using AES-128 and the EAX mode. This standard was developed jointly with ANSI (published asANSI C12.22) and Measurement Canada (published as MC12.22).</abstract>
