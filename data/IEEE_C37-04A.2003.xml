    <abstract>This amendment specifies the capacitance current switching portion of the rating structure for all ac circuit breakers rated above 1000 V, including both outdoor and indoor types having preferred ratings listed in ANSI C37.06-2000. The rating structure establishes the basis for all assigned capacitance current ratings including overhead line switching, cable switching, capacitor bank switching, and back-to-back capacitor bank switching.</abstract>
