    <abstract>This standard specifies the design requirements for new and/or modified Class 1E control boards, panels, and racks and establishes the methods to verify that these requirements have been satisfied. Methods for meeting the separation criteria contained in IEEE Std 384 are addressed. Qualification is also included to address the overall requirements of IEEE Std 323 and recommendations of IEEE Std 344.</abstract>
