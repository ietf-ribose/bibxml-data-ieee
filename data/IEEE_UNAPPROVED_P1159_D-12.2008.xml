    <abstract>This Recommended Practice encompasses the monitoring of electrical characteristics of single-phase and polyphase ac power systems. It includes consistent descriptions of conducted electromagnetic phenomena occurring on power systems. The document describes nominal conditions and deviations from these nominal conditions that may originate within the source of supply or load equipment, or from interactions between the source and the load. Also, this document discusses power quality monitoring devices, application techniques, and interpretation of monitoring results.</abstract>
