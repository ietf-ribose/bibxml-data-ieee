abstract:
  content: 'Superseded by 802.3aa-1998. The ISO/IEC CSMA/CD Media Access Control (MAC)
    is coupled with a family of new Physical Layer specifications to achieve 100 Mb/s
    operation. Known collectively as 100BASE-T, this family of Physical Layer specifications
    includes 100BASE-T4, which uses four pairs of ISO/IEC 11801: 1995 Category 3,
    4, or 5 balanced cable; 100BASE-TX, which uses two pairs of Category 5 balanced
    cable or 150 ohm shielded balanced cable; and 100BASE-FX, which uses two multi-mode
    fibers. The two 100BASE-X specifications (100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX) reused portions
    of the 100 Mb/s physical signaling specifications originally developed for Fibre
    Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).'
