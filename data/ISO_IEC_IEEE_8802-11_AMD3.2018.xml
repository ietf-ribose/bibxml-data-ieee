    <abstract>The IEEE 802.11 directional multi-gigabit (DMG) physical layer (PHY) and the medium access control (MAC) layer are modified by this amendment to IEEE Std 802.11-2016 to enable operation in the Chinese millimeter wave frequency band around 60 GHz. This amendment also defines modifications to the IEEE 802.11 PHY and MAC layer to enable operation in the Chinese millimeter wave frequency band around 45 GHz.</abstract>
