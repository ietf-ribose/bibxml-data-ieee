abstract:
  content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are set
    forth as well ascertain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz., mineral-oil-immersed,
    self-cooled, pad-mounted,compartmental-type distribution transformers. These transformers
    are rated 5 MVA and smaller,with the high voltage limit of 34.5 kV system nominal
    voltage and below, and with low voltage limitof 15 kV system nominal voltage and
    below. This standard covers the connector, bushing andterminal arrangements for
    radial or loop feed systems. This standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical
    requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer.
