    <abstract>Language and coding standards for the PILOT programming language are described. PILOT (Programmed Inquiry, Learning, Or Teaching) is a language for the development of conversational interactive sequences often used for the computer-based instruction. The intent is to improve code portability ant to minimize the development of dialects of this language,thereby improving the sharing of courseware among teaching institutions. PILOT syntax, core statements, and the core language are defined. Variables and language extensions are covered.</abstract>
