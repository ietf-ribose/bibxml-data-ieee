    <abstract>The procedures and calculations necessary to apply the standard transient recovery voltage (TRV) ratings for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V are covered in this guide. The breaking capability limits of these circuit breakers are determined to a great degree by the TRV. The TRV ratings are compared with typical system TRV duties. Examples of TRV calculation are given with suggested options if the TRV duty exceeds the TRV ratings of the circuit breaker.</abstract>
