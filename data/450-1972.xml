  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">Proper maintenance will prolong the life of a battery and will aid in assuring that it is capable of supplying its design power requirements. A good battery maintenance program will serve as a valuable aid in determining the need for battery replacement. Station battery maintenance should be performed by personnel knowledgeable of batteries and the safety precautions involved.</abstract>
