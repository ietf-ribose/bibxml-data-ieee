    <abstract>The purpose and content of all identified systems and software life cycle and service management information items (documentation) are specified in this document. The information item contents are defined according to generic document types (description, plan, policy, procedure, report, request, and specification) and the specific purpose of the document. This document provides a mapping of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 clauses with a set of information items. This document identifies records and information items based on analysis of references in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, which in some cases provide partial or complete outlines for the content of specific documents. Information items may be combined or subdivided as needed for project or organizational purposes.</abstract>
