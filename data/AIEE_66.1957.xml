    <abstract>This guide presents general recommendations for determining, by approximate methods from nameplate data and by more exact methods from design data, the short-circuit characteristics of direct-current motors and generators. Both methods are applicable to general purpose, general industrial mill motors, and special purpose direct-current machines. This includes constant-speed and adjustable-speed motors and machines with and without compound windings, and with and without compensating windings.</abstract>
