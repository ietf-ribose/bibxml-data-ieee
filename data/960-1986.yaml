abstract:
  content: Mechanical, signal, electrical, and protocol specifications are given for
    a modular data bus system, which, while allowing equipment designers a wide choice
    of solutions, ensure compatibility of all designs that obey the mandatory parts
    of the specification. This standard applies to systems consisting of modular electronic
    instrument units that process or transfer data or signals, normally in association
    with computers or other automatic data processors.
