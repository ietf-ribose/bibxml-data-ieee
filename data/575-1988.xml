    <abstract>The guide describes the most common sheath-bonding systems now in use and the methods of calculating sheath voltages and currents, particularly as applied to three-phase systems operating at 60 kV and above, with the neutral grounded directly or through an impedance. The user is cautioned to make sure that a design does not contravene any local or national regulations.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
