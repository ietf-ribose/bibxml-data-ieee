    <abstract>This standard was developed to assist users of IEEE/ISO/IEC 15288:2008, Systems engineering –System life cycle processes, or IEEE/ISO/IEC 12207:2008, Information technology – Software life cycle processes, to acquire or supply software user documentation as part of the software life cycle processes. It defines the documentation process from the acquirer’s standpoint and the supplier’s standpoint. This standard covers the requirements for information items used in the acquisition of user documentation products: the Acquisition Plan, Document Specification, Statement of Work, Request for Proposals, and the proposal. It provides an overview of the software user documentation and information management processes which may require acquisition and supply of software user documentation products and services. It addresses the preparation of requirements for software user documentation. These requirements are central to the user documentation specification and Statement of Work. It includes requirements for primary document outputs of the acquisition and supply process: the Request for Proposal and the Proposal for user documentation products and services. It also discusses the use of a Documentation Management Plan and a Document Plan as they arise in the acquisition and supply processes. The standard is independent of the software tools that may be used to produce documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation. Much of its guidance is applicable to user documentation for systems including hardware as well as software.</abstract>
