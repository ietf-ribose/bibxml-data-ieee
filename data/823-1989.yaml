abstract:
  content: This IEEE Std 823-1989 provides network planners with the methodology and
    models for calculating the transmission performance of connections made up of
    one channel or of two or more tandem channels. The performance parameters covered
    include connection loss, idle-circuit and quantisation noise, and talker echo
    path loss and delay. The methodology is given for determining the speech transmission
    performance and grade of service of a complete voice connection including the
    terminals (telephone sets), and evaluating the relative performance of alternative
    speech connections.<<ETX>>
