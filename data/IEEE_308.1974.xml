    <abstract>This standard applies to the electric systems in stationary single unit and multi-unit nuclear power generating stations that provide electric power to the Class IE equipment. The electric systems included are comprised of the following interrelated systems: (1)alternating-current power systems, (2) direct-current power systems, (3) vital instrumentation and control power systems. This standard also contains requirements for non-Class IE interfaces such as the preferred power supply. The purpose of this standard is to provide: the principal design criteria and the design features of the Class IE power systems that enable the systems to meet their functional requirement under the conditions produced by the applicable design basis events; and the requirements for surveillance of the class IE power system.</abstract>
