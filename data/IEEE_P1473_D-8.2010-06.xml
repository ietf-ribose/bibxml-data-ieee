    <abstract>Communications protocols to be used for inter-unit and intra-unit serial data communications between subsystems aboard passenger trains are defined by this standard. Minimum acceptable parameters for a network that can simultaneously handle monitoring and control traffic from multiple systems are set forth.While the network is not vital, it is intended to be capable of carrying vital messages</abstract>
