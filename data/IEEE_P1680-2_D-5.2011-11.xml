    <abstract>This standard establishes a clear and consistent set of environmental performance criteria for the design of imaging equipment products, providing an opportunity to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of electronic products. This standard is also intended to provide a tool for government, institutional, corporate and consumer purchasers to identify products that demonstrate environmental leadership. This standard shall be updated and revised on a periodic basis to continue to set a higher performance standard for leadership products.</abstract>
