    <abstract>The operational and performance requirements for transportable and/or mobile radiation monitors used in homeland security applications are specified in this standard. Transportable radiation monitors are designed to be transported to a location and used for a specific task or for a specified period of time and do not require permanent mounting platforms. Mobile monitors are those monitors that are typically in operation on a platform that is in motion.</abstract>
