    <abstract>This standard specifies the design, installation, and test parameters for a broadband cable medium. The medium supports the communication of IEEE 802.3b, IEEE 802.4, video, and narrow-band radio frequency (RF) modem devices. The broadband bus topology consists of amplifiers, coaxial cable, and directional couplers that create a full duplex directional medium. Inbound signals flow from user outlet transmitters to a central headend location. The headend processes the signals and then transmits the signals via an outbound path to all the user outlets. The medium utilizes frequency division multiplexing (FDM), which supports the simultaneous coexistence of services. Each service is assigned a unique inbound and outbound channel frequency.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
