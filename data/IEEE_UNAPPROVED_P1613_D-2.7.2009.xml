    <abstract>Service conditions, electrical ratings, thermal ratings and environmental testing requirements are defined for communications networking devices to be installed in electric power substations. This standard establishes a common reproducible basis for designing and evaluating communications networking devices and the communications ports of protective relays for use in this harsh environment.</abstract>
