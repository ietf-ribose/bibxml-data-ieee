    <abstract>Superseded by 1070-1995. A generic specification, including design and testing, is provided for transmission modular restoration structure components being widely used today by many electric utilities, both publicly and privately owned. It can be used by electric utilities for acquisition of transmission modular restoration structure components, to ensure that the particular design is compatible with structures presently in use within the industry. This would enhance transmission mutual aid. Testing is prescribed to provide a high confidence level between manufacturers and/or suppliers and to promote competitive acquisition practices within the industry.</abstract>
