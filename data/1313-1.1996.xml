    <abstract>The procedure for selection of the withstand voltages for equipment phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase insulation systems is specified. A list of standard insulation levels, based on the voltage stress to which the equipment is being exposed, is also identified. This standard applies to three-phase ac systems above 1 kV.</abstract>
