- content: Support for optionally powering a 10BASE-T,100BASE-TX or 1000BASE-T DTE
    device via the Power Interface (PI)using physical layers defined in Clauses 14,25,and
    40.The Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)is located at an endpoint or midspan,separate
    from and between the MDIs,and provides power to the Powered Device (PD)over the
    Link Section.The PSE detection protocol distinguishes a compatible PD from non-compatible
    devices and precludes the application of power and possible damage to non-compatible
    devices.The PSE monitors the Maintain Power Signature (MPS)and removes power when
    it is no longer requested or required.Optional management function requirements
    are specified.
