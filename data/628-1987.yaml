abstract:
  content: Criteria for the minimum requirements in the selection, design, installation,
    and qualification of raceway systems for Class 1E circuits for nuclear power generating
    stations are provided. Methods for the structural qualification of such raceway
    systems are prescribed. Since aging and radiation have no known detrimental effect
    upon metallic raceway systems, and since nonmetallic raceway systems are limited
    to underground or embedded applications, these two environmental conditions are
    not considered, nor are the embedments or structural members to which a support
    is attached.
