abstract:
  content: 'A detailed test procedure is provided for determining the ampacity derating
    factor in the following cable installation configurations: block-out or sleeve
    type cable penetration fire stops; conduits covered with a protective material;
    tray covered with a protective material; cable directly covered or coated with
    a fire-retardant material; and free-air drops enclosed with a protective material.'
