    <abstract>This guide describes measures that may be taken to help mitigate tank rupture of energized liquid-immersed power transformers and reactors due to internal electrical faults. This guide does not cover the release of oil or oil mist due to failure of the following components: load tap changer compartments, bushings and their turrets, conservator tank, piping, valves, pumps and radiators.</abstract>
