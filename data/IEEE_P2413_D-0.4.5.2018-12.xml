    <abstract>An architecture framework description for the Internet of Things (IoT) which conforms to the international standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 is defined. The architecture framework description is motivated by concerns commonly shared by IoT system stakeholders across multiple domains (transportation, healthcare, Smart Grid, etc.). A conceptual basis for the notion of things in the IoT is provided and the shared concerns as a collection of architecture viewpoints is elaborated to form the body of the framework description.</abstract>
