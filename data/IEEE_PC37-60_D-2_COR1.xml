    <abstract>This Standard applies to all overhead, pad mounted, dry vault and submersible single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers and fault interrupters for rated maximum voltages above 1000 V and up to 38 kV. In order to simplify this standard where possible, the term recloser/FI (reclosers/FIs) has been substituted for automatic circuit recloser or fault interrupter or both. NOTE--When reclosers are applied in substation, special considerations may apply.</abstract>
