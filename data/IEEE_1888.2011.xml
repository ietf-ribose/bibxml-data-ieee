    <abstract>The standard describes remote control architecture of digital community, intelligent building groups, and digital metropolitan networks; specifies interactive data format between devices and systems; and gives a standardized generalization of equipment, data communication interface, and interactive message in this digital community network. The digital community remote control network opens interfaces for public administration, public service, property management service, and individual service, which enables intelligent interconnection, collaboration service, remote surveillance, and central management to be feasible.</abstract>
