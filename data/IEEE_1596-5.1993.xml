    <abstract>Formats for interchanging integer, bit-field, and floating point data between heterogeneous multiprocessors in a Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) system are specified. The defined data formats can also be used to share data among multiprocessors on other bus standards that support the read, write, and lock transaction set defined by IEEE Std 1212-1991 CSR Architecture. The intent is to support efficient data transfers among heterogeneous workstations within a distributed computing environment. (No longer endorsed by the IEEE)</abstract>
