    <abstract>This ANSI ESD guide provides expanded explanations, best practices, and guidance for avoiding the pitfalls associated with ESD testing to IEC and other international ESD standards and should be considered a supplement to these standards, rather than a replacement. It also includes unique ESD test procedures related to connecting charged peripherals to equipment in use.</abstract>
