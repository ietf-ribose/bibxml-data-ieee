    <abstract>This guide contains general and specific recommendations fo 1 r grounding current and voltage transformer secondary circuits and cases of connected equipment. Although most diagrams included in this guide show relaying applications, the recommended practices apply equally to metering and other areas where instrument transformers are used. The guide includes grounding practices presently used and practices that were not previously reported. Specifically, a review of other than North American grounding practices is included.</abstract>
