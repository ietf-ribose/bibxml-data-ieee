    <abstract>Metal-clad (MC) medium-voltage switchgear that contains drawout electrically operated circuit breakers is covered. MC switchgear is compartmentalized to isolate components such as instrumentation, main bus, and both incoming and outgoing connections with grounded metal barriers. Rated maximum voltage levels for metal-clad switchgear range from 4.76 kV to 38 kV with main bus continuous current ratings of 1200 A, 2000 A, 3000 A, and 4000 A. MC switchgear also contains associated control, instruments, metering, relaying, protective, and regulating devices, as necessary. Service conditions, ratings, temperature limitations and classification of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and applications are discussed.</abstract>
