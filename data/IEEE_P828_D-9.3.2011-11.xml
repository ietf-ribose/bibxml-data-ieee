    <abstract>Abstract: This standard 1 establishes the minimum requirements for processes for Configuration Management (CM) in Systems and software engineering. The application of this standard applies to any form, class, or type of software or system. This revision of the standard expands the previous version to explain CM, including identifying and acquiring configuration items, controlling changes, reporting the status of configuration items, as well as software builds and release engineering. Its predecessor defined only the contents of a software configuration management plan. This standard addresses what CM activities are to be done, when they are to happen in the lifecycle, and what planning and resources are required. It also describes the content areas for a CM Plan. The standard supports ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2008 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2008 and adheres to the terminology in ISO/IEC/IEEE Std 24765 and the information item requirements of IEEE Std15939, Software and system engineering --Measurement process</abstract>
