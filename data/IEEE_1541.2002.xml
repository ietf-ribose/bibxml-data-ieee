    <abstract>Reaffirmed 2008. Names and letter symbols for prefixes that denote multiplication of a unit by the binary multiplier 2 10 n ,where n =1,2,3,4,5,or 6 are defined. Although the prefixes may be used with all units in all fields where multiplication by a binary multiplier is found to be appropriate, their primary use is in the field of information technology.</abstract>
