abstract:
  content: The purpose of this document is to facilitate the joint usage of the process
    content of the latest revisions of both ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,
    by providing unified and consolidated guidance on life cycle management of systems
    and software. This is to help ensure consistency in system concepts and life cycle
    concepts, models, stages, processes, process application, key points of view,
    adaptation and use in various domains as the two International Standards are used
    in combination. That will in turn help a project team design a life cycle model
    for managing the progress of their project. Hence, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 are the documents that apply the concepts found in this document to specific
    processes.
