- content: The data format to be used for both required and optional data to be made
    available by radiation measurement instruments for homeland security applications
    is specified. The performance for these types of instruments is described in other
    standards, such as ANSI N42.32, ANSI N42.33, ANSI N42.34, ANSI N42.35, ANSI N42.38,
    ANSI N42.43, ANSI N42.48, ANSI N42.49A, and ANSI N42.53. (The PDF of this standard
    is available to you at no cost compliments of the IEEE GET program at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=83)
