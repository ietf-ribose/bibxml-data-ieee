    <abstract>Power-line carrier (PLC) line-tuning equipment connected between the coupling capacitors and PLC transmitter/receiver terminals operating in the frequency range of 30 kHz to 500 kHz over power transmission lines and cables or to similar line-tuning equipment in a carrier bypass are addressed in this standard. PLC line-tuning equipment includes assemblies and components: tuning inductor, impedance matching transformer, balancing transformer, tuning capacitor, inductance-capacitance (LC) tuning unit, hybrid, filter, protective unit, interconnecting cables, and enclosure. This standard includes the protective devices that facilitate the safe operation and maintenance of the line-tuning components under normal and usual operating conditions. This standard will develop technical definitions, performance ratings, testing methods, and manufacturing requirements for the included line-tuning equipment.</abstract>
