abstract:
  content: Withdrawn Standard. This standard defines a set of software development
    activities and resulting software products. It provides a framework for software
    development planning and engineering. It is also intended to merge commercial
    and Government software development requirements within the framework of the software
    life cycle process requirements of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA),
    Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and International Organization
    for Standardization (ISO). The term software development is used as an inclusive
    term encompassing new development, modification, reuse, reengineering, maintenance,
    and all other processes or activities resulting in software products.
