  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This document provides common terminology and recommended practices for initiating and conducting event investigations, analyzing data, producing results, and identifying corrective actions associated with facility personnel, processes, equipment and systems at nuclear facilities. The scope of event investigation activities addressed includes, but is not limited to, root cause analysis, which is an in depth investigation process used to identify primary causes of an event based on the systematic and consistent use of analysis tools. This recommended practice can be used for the investigation of all events and allows the use of a graduated approach to the depth of the investigation based upon the event significance.</abstract>
