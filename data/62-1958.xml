    <abstract>The primary purpose of this Guide is to present and discuss the applicability and limitations of the various measurement methods now in use, or available, for testing the electrical insulation of power apparatus in the field. The purpose of this Guide is also to consider the special conditions encountered in field testing, and their effect on instruments, methods and procedures for making tests on the electrical insulation of power apparatus.</abstract>
