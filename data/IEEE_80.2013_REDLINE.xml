    <abstract>This guide is primarily concerned with outdoor ac substations, either conventional or gas-insulated. These include distribution, transmission, and generating plant substations. With proper caution, the methods described herein are also applicable to indoor portions of such substations, or to substations that are wholly indoors. No attempt is made to cover the grounding problems peculiar to dc substations. A quantitative analysis of the effects of lightning surges is also beyond the scope of this guide. (Incorporates IEEE Std P80-2013/Cor 1-2015)</abstract>
