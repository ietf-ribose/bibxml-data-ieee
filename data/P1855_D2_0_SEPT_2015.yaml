abstract:
  content: This standard presents a new specification language, named Fuzzy Markup
    Language(FML), exploiting the benefits offered by eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
    specifications and related tools in order to model a fuzzy logic system in a human-readable
    and hardware independent way. Therefore, it provides designers of industrial fuzzy
    systems with a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable
    fuzzy systems. This Standard uses the W3C XML Schema definition language to define
    the syntax and semantics of the FML programs.
