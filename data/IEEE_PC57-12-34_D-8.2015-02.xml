    <abstract>Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are set forth as well ascertain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz., mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, pad-mounted,compartmental-type distribution transformers. These transformers are rated 5 MVA and smaller,with the high voltage limit of 34.5 kV system nominal voltage and below, and with low voltage limitof 15 kV system nominal voltage and below. This standard covers the connector, bushing andterminal arrangements for radial or loop feed systems. This standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer.</abstract>
