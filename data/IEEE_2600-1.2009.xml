    <abstract>This standard is for a protection profile for hardcopy devices in a restrictive commercial information processing environment in which a relatively high level of document security, operational accountability, and information assurance are required. Typical information processed in this environment is trade secret, mission critical, or subject to legal and regulatory considerations such as for privacy or governance. This environment is not intended to support life-critical or national security applications. This environment will be known as "Operational Environment A".</abstract>
