    <abstract>Superseded. This guide provides a basis for the systematic evaluation of man- machine performance in nuclear power generating station control rooms and other peripheries, as such performance relates to nuclear plant safety. Basic information is supplied as to the available human factors techniques and their applicability to the various human-related issues confronting the commercial nuclear industry today. A brief review is provided of selected, commonly used techniques, along with guidance as to their use and where further related information can be obtained.</abstract>
