    <abstract>The purpose of this trial-use standard is to provide common terminology and test methods for describing the performance of waveform recorders. Since these devices give only digital answers that are intended to be sent to a computer for analysis, a highly analytical approach has been taken, perhaps more than other instrumentation standards committees. Instruments covered by this trial-use standard are electronic digitizing waveform recorders, waveform analyzers, and digitizing oscilloscopes with digital outputs. This trial-use standard is directed toward, but not restricted to, general-purpose waveform recorders and analyzers. Special applications may require additional manufacturer information and verification tests.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
