    <abstract>Procedures for demonstrating the adequacy of new Class 1E transformers, located in amild environment of a nuclear power generating station, to perform their required safety functionsunder postulated service conditions are presented. Single- and three-phase transformers rated601 V to 15 000 V for the highest voltage winding and up to 2500 kVA (self-cooled rating) arecovered. Because of the conservative approach used in the development of this new standard fornew transformers, the end-point criteria cannot be used for in-service transformers.</abstract>
