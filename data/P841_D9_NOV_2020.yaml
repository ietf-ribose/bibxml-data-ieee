abstract:
  content: This standard applies to premium-efficiency totally enclosed fan-cooled
    (TEFC) and totally enclosed nonventilated (TENV), horizontal and vertical, single-speed,
    squirrel cage polyphase induction motors, 0.75 kW to 370 kW (1 hp to 500 hp),
    and up to 4000 V nominal, in National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)
    frame sizes 143T and larger, for petroleum, chemical, and other severe-duty applications
    (commonly referred to as premium-efficiency severe-duty motors). Excluded from
    the scope of this standard are motors with sleeve bearings and additional specific
    features required for explosion-proof motors.
