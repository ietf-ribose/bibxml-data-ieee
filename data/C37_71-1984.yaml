abstract:
  content: This standard applies to three-phase group-operated 60-Hz subsurface load-interrupting
    switches with maximum ratings of 600 A and 38 kV that utilize separable insulated
    connectors. It covers service conditions; ratings and test requirements; design,
    production, and conformance tests; construction requirements; and shipping requirements.
