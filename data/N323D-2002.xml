    <abstract>This standard establishes specific requirements for installed instruments that measure dose, dose equivalent, dose rate, or dose equivalent rate and for installed instruments used to detect and/or measure the presence of radioactive contamination. This standard does not address criticality detection systems. For this standard, installed radiation protection instruments are instruments that operate using line power primarily. They are also not hand-carried during use, and they are typically operated at a fixed location. Instrument types include, but are not limited to, area, equipment, sample, personnel, and waste monitors. Special purpose instrumentation, such as emergency post-accident radiological monitors, fall under the scope of other related ANSI standards. This standard is intended to supplement rather than replace them.</abstract>
