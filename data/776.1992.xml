    <abstract>The inductive environment that exists in the vicinity of electric power and wire-line telecommunications systems and the interfering effects that may be produced are addressed. An interface that permits either party, without need to involve the other, to verify the induction at the interface by use of a probe wire is presented. This recommended practice does not apply to railway signal circuits.</abstract>
