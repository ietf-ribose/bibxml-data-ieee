abstract:
  content: This guide is intended for the hydroelectric power industry to assist hydroelectric
    1 power plant owners, operators, and designers in the economic (feasibility) and
    technical evaluation (electrical aspects) of existing hydroelectric installations
    for rehabilitation. It addresses conventional hydropower. Portions of this guide
    are relevant to pumped storage but the unique features of pumped storage are not
    covered. Feasibility study results may indicate redevelopment of the site. Redevelopment
    will not be treated in detail in this guide. This guide covers all generating
    equipment up to and including the main transformer and typical auxiliary equipment.
