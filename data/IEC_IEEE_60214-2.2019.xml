    <abstract>This part of IEC 60214 is intended to assist in the selection of tap-changers designed in accordance with IEC 60214-1 or IEEE Std C57.131 for use in conjunction with the tapped windings of transformers or reactors. Requirements, references and definitions relevant to either IEC 60214-1 or IEEE Std C57.131 are given and their use is described in Clause 4. It is also intended to assist in understanding the various types of tap-changers and their associated equipment available. These application guidelines cover on-load tap-changers (resistor and reactor types) and de-energized tap-changers.</abstract>
