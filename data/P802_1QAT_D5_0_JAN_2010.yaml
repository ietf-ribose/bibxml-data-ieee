abstract:
  content: This standard provides a signaling protocol to enable the end- to-end management
    of resource reservation for quality of service (QoS) guaranteed streams. The signaling
    protocol facilitates the registration, deregistration, and retention of resource
    reservation information in relevant network elements. The signaling protocol is
    an essential component for automatic configuration in bridged local area network
    applications that require latency and bandwidth guarantees.
