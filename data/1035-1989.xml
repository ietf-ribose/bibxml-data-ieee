    <abstract>The following topics were dealt with: This test procedure is a recommended practice for testing utility-interconnected static power converters. The test procedure applies to single- and three-phase units rated from 1 kW to 500 kW and may also be applied in principle to larger units. The objective of this test procedure is the measurement of electrical parameters at the AC terminals of the power converter. The test procedure may serve as a basis for factory or acceptance testing. It focuses on equipment that lends itself to mass production and is readily interconnected to an electric utility, rather than on equipment subject to site-specific design and testing. Test results may be used in evaluating or comparing different types of static power converters.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
