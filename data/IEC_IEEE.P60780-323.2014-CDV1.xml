    <abstract>This standard is applicable to electrical equipment important to safety and its interfaces thatare necessary to perform a safety function, or whose failure could adversely affect, the safetyfunctions of other equipment.Electrical equipment in nuclear facilities shall meet its safety functional requirements throughout its installed life. This is accomplished by a thorough programme of quality assurance, design control, quality control, qualification, production, transportation, storage, installation, maintenance, periodic testing, and surveillance. This IEC/IEEE standard specifically focuses on qualification.Other aspects, relating to quality assurance, reliability, selection and use of electronic devices, design and modification of digital systems including V&amp;V activities are not part of this standard.</abstract>
