    <abstract>Characteristics relating to performance, limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and guidance to assist in the proper selection of sealed dry-type transformers are provided in this standard. Specific rating combinations are described in the range from 750 to 5000 kVA inclusive, with high-voltage 2400 to 34500 Volts inclusive and low-voltage 208Y/120 to 4160 Volts inclusive. Sealed dry-type power transformers filled with only dry air or nitrogen, at the time of filling, are considered. Other gases are not considered in this standard. This standard does not apply to other types of transformers, such as specialty, ventilated dry-type, pad-mounted dry-type, liquid immersed, instrument, regulating, furnace, mine, and rectifier transformers.</abstract>
