    <abstract>This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective functions of: 1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices 2) direct-acting overcurrent electronic trip systems 3) reverse-current trip systems 4) undervoltage trip devices that are integral with low-voltage ac (1000 V and below) and general-purpose low-voltage dc (1500 V and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE Std C37.13, and IEEE Std C37.14. Additional information, communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions or devices are not covered by this standard. This standard should not be interpreted to restrict the inclusion of such functionality in the device.</abstract>
