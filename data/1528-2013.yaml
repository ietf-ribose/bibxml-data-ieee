abstract:
- content: 'Protocols and test procedures are specified for the measurement of the
    peak spatial-average SAR induced inside a simplified model of the head of users
    of certain handheld radio transceivers. These transceivers are intended to be
    used for personal wireless communications services, operate in the 300 MHz to
    6 GHz frequency range, and are intended to be operated while held against the
    ear. The results obtained by following the protocols specified in this recommended
    practice represent a conservative estimate of the peak spatial-average SAR induced
    in the head of a significant majority of persons, subject to measurement and other
    uncertainties that are defined in this recommended practice. The results are representative
    of those expected during conditions of intended use of a handheld wireless device.
    It is not the intent of this recommended practice to provide a result representative
    of the absolute maximum SAR value possible under every conceivable combination
    of head size, head shape, handset orientation, and spacing relative to the head.
    The measurement of SAR induced in the external tissues of the head, e.g., the
    external ear (pinna), is not addressed in this document. This recommended practice
    also does not address the body SAR measurements typically required for wireless
    handsets. The following items are described in detail: measurement concepts, measurement
    techniques, instruments, calibration techniques, simulated-tissue (phantom) models,
    including homogeneous anatomically equivalent models of the human head and simple
    phantoms for validation of the SAR measurement system, and the limitations of
    these systems when used for measuring the spatial-peak mass-averaged SAR. Procedures
    for calibrating electric field (E-field) probes used for SAR measurements and
    assessing the SAR measurement and system uncertainties are'

    for calibrating electric field (E-field) probes used for SAR measurements and

    This recommended practice is intended primarily for use by engineers and other
    specialists who are familiar with electromagnetic (EM) theory and SAR measurement
    techniques; it does not recommend specific SAR limit values since these are found
    in other documents. The benefits to the users include standardized and accepted
    protocols, validation techniques, and means for estimating the overall measurement
    uncertainty in order to produce valid and repeatable data.'
