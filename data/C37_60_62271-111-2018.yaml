abstract:
  content: This part of IEC 62271 applies to all overhead, pad-mounted, dry vault
    and submersible single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers
    for rated maximum voltages above 1 000 V and up to and including 38 kV. Devices
    that require a dependent manual operation are not covered by this document. In
    order to simplify this document where possible, the term recloser (or reclosers)
    has been substituted for automatic circuit recloser(s) or cutout mounted recloser(s)
    or both.
