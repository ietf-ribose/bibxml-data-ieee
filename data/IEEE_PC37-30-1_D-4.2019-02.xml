    <abstract>Required ratings, construction requirements, design test requirements, applications and suggested practices for all high voltage enclosed indoor and outdoor and non-enclosed indoor and outdoor switches rated above 1,000 V are specified. This includes ratings and requirements for such switches as disconnecting, selector, horn-gap, grounding, etc., for manual and power operation, except for interrupter switches, distribution-enclosed single-pole air switches and distribution cutouts fitted with disconnecting blades.</abstract>
