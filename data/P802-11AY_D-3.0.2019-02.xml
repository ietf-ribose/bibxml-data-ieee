    <abstract>In this amendment to IEEE Std 802.11-2020, standardized modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 physical layer (PHY) and the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) sublayer are defined to enable at least one mode of operation capable of supporting a maximum throughput of at least 20 gigabits per second (measured at the MAC data service access point), while maintaining or improving the power efficiency per station.</abstract>
