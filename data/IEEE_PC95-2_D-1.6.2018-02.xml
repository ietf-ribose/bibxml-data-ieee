    <abstract>Symbols to inform people about the presence of potentially hazardous levels of radio-frequency energy or the presence of contact current hazards in the frequency range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz are specified in this standard. Guidance is given about how these symbols should be used on warning signs and labels.</abstract>
