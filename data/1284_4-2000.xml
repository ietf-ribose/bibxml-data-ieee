    <abstract>A device to carry on multiple, concurrent exchanges of data and/or control information with another device across a single point-to-point link allowed by the packet protocol is described in this standard. The protocol is not a device control language. The protocol provides basic transport-level flow control and multiplexing services. The multiplexed information exchanges are independent, and blocking of one has no effect on any other. The protocol shall operate over inter-faces such as described in IEEE Std 1284-2000.</abstract>
