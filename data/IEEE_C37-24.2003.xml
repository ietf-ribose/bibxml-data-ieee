    <abstract>This guide provides information to assist in evaluating the effect of solar radiation on outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear including metal-enclosed bus and control switchboards. Specific data are given in the form of a continuous current capability factor for specific maximum monthly normal temperatures at the installation location, to adjust the continuous current capability of outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear to the solar radiation condition required. Tables of maximum monthly normal temperatures at various locations in the US and Canada are provided.</abstract>
