    <abstract>Information on the application, operation and maintenance of high-voltage fuses (above 1000 V), distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for use on ac distribution systems is provided. This guide is one of a series of complementary standards covering various types of high-voltage fuses and switches, so arranged that two of the standards apply to all devices while each of the other standards provide additional specifications for a particular device. For each device, IEEE Std C37.40-1993, IEEE Std C37.41- 1994, plus the standard covering that device, constitute a complete set of standards for each device. In addition, IEEE Std C37.48-1997 is an application, operation, and maintenance guide for all the devices.</abstract>
