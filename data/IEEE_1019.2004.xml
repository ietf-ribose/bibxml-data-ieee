    <abstract>Minimum requirements for the construction, manufacturing, purchasing, and application of electric submersible pump cable are presented. The cable is round or flat, with polypropylene rubber insulation, nitrile jacket, and armor. These cables are for voltages not exceeding 3 kV or 5 kV (phase to phase) and conductor temperatures not exceeding 96 degC (205 degF) for nitrile or a maximum of -10 degC (14 degF). Conductors, insulation, assembly and jacket, armor, requirements for testing by the manufacturer, and cable ampacity are covered</abstract>
