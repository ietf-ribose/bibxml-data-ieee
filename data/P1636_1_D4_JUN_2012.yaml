abstract:
  content: This standard is intended to promote and facilitate interoperability between
    components of automatic test systems where test results need to be shared. The
    standard thus facilitates the capture of test results data in storage devices
    and databases, facilitating online and offline analysis. The test results schema
    becomes a class of information that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards.
    The exchange format utilizes the XML formats.
