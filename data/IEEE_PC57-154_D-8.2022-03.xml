    <abstract>All liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers that are designed to operate at temperatures that exceed the normal thermal limits of IEEE C57.12.00TM under continuous load, in the designed average ambient, and at rated conditions are covered by this standard. Specific requirements and guidance in the design, testing, and application of the transformers covered within the scope of this standard are provided. High-temperature insulation systems or systems that use a combination of high-temperature and conventional insulation are incorporated by these transformers.</abstract>
