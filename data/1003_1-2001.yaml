abstract:
  content: This standard defines a standard operating system interface and environment,
    including a command interpreter (or "shell"), and common utility programs to support
    applications portability at the source code level. It is the single common revision
    to IEEE Std 1003.1-1996, IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, and the Base Specifications of
    The Open Group Single UNIX(TM)â€  Specification, Version 2. This standard is intended
    to be used by both applications developers and system implementors and comprises
    four major components (each in an associated volume)
