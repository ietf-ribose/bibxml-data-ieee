abstract:
  content: This standard specifies interchange and arithmetic formats and methods
    for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming environments.
    This standard specifies exception conditions and their default handling. An implementation
    of a floating-point system conforming to this standard can be realized entirely
    in software, entirely in hardware, or in any combination of software and hardware.
    For operations specified in the normative part of this standard, numerical results
    and exceptions are uniquely determined by the values of the input data, sequence
    of operations, and destination formats, all under user control.
