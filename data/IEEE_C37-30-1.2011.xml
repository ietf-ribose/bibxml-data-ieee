    <abstract>Required ratings, construction requirements, design test requirements, applications, and suggested practices for all high-voltage enclosed indoor and outdoor and nonenclosed indoor and outdoor switches rated above 1000 V are specified. This includes ratings and requirements for such switches as disconnecting, selector, horn-gap, and grounding for manual and power operation, except for interrupter switches, distribution-enclosed single-pole air switches, and distribution cutouts fitted with disconnecting blades.</abstract>
