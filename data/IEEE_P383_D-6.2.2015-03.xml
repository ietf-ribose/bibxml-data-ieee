    <abstract>General requirements and methods for qualifying electric cables and splices for nuclear facilities are provided. Cable, wire, and splices within or integral to other devices (e.g., instruments, panels, motors) should be qualified using the requirements in the applicable device standard or IEEE Std 323(TM). However, this standards requirements may be applied to the cable, wire and splices within these devices. For qualification of fiber optic cable, refer to IEEE Std 1682(TM).</abstract>
