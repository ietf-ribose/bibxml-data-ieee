    <abstract>The existing low-energy critical infrastructure monitoring (LECIM) frequency shift keying (FSK) physical layer of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015 is extended to be more robust in presence of interference and achieve higher link budgets for applications in low power wide area networks (LPWAN). Lower symbol rates and a split mode with low rate forward error correction (FEC) codes are introduced to achieve this goal.</abstract>
