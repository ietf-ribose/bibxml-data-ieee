abstract:
- content: How all or part of a network can be secured transparently to peer protocol
    entities that use the MAC Service provided by IEEE 802&#x00AE; LANs to communicate
    is specified in this standard. MAC security (MACsec) provides connectionless user
    data confidentiality, frame data integrity, and data origin authenticity.
