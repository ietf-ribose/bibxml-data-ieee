abstract:
  content: Practical methods for making electroacoustic laboratory measurements of
    analog and digital speech communications terminals and connected audio devices
    are contained in this standard. The methods are applicable to a wide variety of
    wired, wireless, cordless, and mobile communication terminals. Examples include
    Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Wi-Fi&#174;, and softphone devices. Tests
    applicable to connected audio devices such as wired, Bluetooth&#174;, and universal
    serial bus (USB) handsets, headsets, and wearables are included. The standard
    contains objective metrics, subjective metrics, and subjective metric predictors.
    Application is in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
