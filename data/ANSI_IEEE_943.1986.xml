    <abstract>Background information necessary for proper construction of aging mechanisms and selection of diagnostic procedures when designing tests for functional evaluation of insulation systems for electrical equipment is presented. Aging mechanisms of insulation systems and methods for ascertaining correlation of aging during testing and aging during actual service are described. Diagnostic techniques for use in functional tests are also listed. The intent is primarily to aid committees in standardizing tests within the scope of their responsibilities.</abstract>
