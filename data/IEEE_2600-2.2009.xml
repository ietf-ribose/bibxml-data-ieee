    <abstract>This standard is for a protection profile for hardcopy devices in a commercial information processing environment in which a moderate level of document security, network security, and security assurance are required. Typically, the day-to-day proprietary and nonproprietary information needed to operate an enterprise will be handled by this environment. This environment will be known as "Operational Environment B".</abstract>
