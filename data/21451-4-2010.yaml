abstract:
- content: This standard defines the protocol and interface that allows analog transducers
    to communicate digital information with an IEEE 1451 object. It also defines the
    format of the Transducer TEDS. The Transducer TEDS is based on the IEEE 1451.2&#x2122;
    TEDS. The standard does not specify the transducer design, signal conditioning,
    or the specific use of the TEDS.

- content: Adoption of IEEE Std 1451.2-1997. A digital interface for connecting transducers
    to microprocessors is defined. A Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS) and
    its data formats are described. An electrical interface, read and write logic
    functions to access the TEDS and a wide variety of transducers are defined. This
    standard does not specify signal conditioning, signal conversion, or how the TEDS
    data is used in applications.
