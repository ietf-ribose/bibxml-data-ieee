abstract:
  content: This Guide provides information to assist users of gaskets in evaluating
    gasket measurement techniques to determine which exhibit the properties critical
    to the intended application, to highlight limitations and sources of error of
    the competing measurement techniques, and to provide a basis for comparing the
    techniques. Emphasis is placed on those measurement techniques which have been
    adopted through incorporation into standards, both commercial and military, or
    have been extensively used.
