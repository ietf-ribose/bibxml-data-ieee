    <abstract>Minimum acceptable performance criteria for health physics instrumentation for use in ionizing radiation fields are established. Included are testing methods to establish the acceptability of each type of instrumentation. This standard does not specify which instruments or systems are required, nor does it consider the number of specific applications of such instruments.</abstract>
