    <abstract>Standardization of circuit integrity cable testing is beneficial to cable manufactures, distributors, and users. Uniform procedures, consistent, repeatable results, and measureable test acceptance criteria are required to allow comparisons among competing products and to allow selection of the correct product for the application. In nuclear power facilities, electrical cables are relied upon to safely control the plant systems. Circuit integrity cables serve as fire-resistive protection for electrical circuits. Circuit integrity cables with a 1-hour or 3-hour ratings are expected to protect the electrical circuit from the effects of severe fire conditions to allow for achieving and maintaining safe shutdown conditions and suppression activities.</abstract>
