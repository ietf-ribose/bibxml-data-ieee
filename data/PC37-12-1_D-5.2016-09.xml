    <abstract>This guide provides a recommended table of contents for high-voltage circuit breaker instruction manuals. The guide provides a listing of information that will help a knowledgeable user receive, install, commission, operate, and maintain circuit breakers. Recommended additional material is described in Clause 5 for circuit breakers that are intended for high-voltage, free-standing installations. Drawout circuit breakers used in switchgear are excluded from Clause 5 requirements. Circuit breakers used in gas-insulated switchgear installations are excluded from this guide. This guide in no way replaces the manufacturerâ€™s instruction manual, which is to be used for safe and effective utilization of the circuit breaker. This guide helps organize instruction manual information in a consistent and user-friendly manner.</abstract>
