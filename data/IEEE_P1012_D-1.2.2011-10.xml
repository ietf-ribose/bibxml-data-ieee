    <abstract>Verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes determine whether the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity and whether the product satisfies its intended use and user needs. V&amp;V life cycle process requirements are specified for different integrity levels. The scope of V&amp;V processes encompasses systems, software, and hardware, and includes their interfaces. This standard applies to systems, software, and hardware being developed, maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), non developmental items]. The term software also includes firmware and microcode, and each of the terms system, software and hardware includes documentation. V&amp;V processes include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing of products.</abstract>
