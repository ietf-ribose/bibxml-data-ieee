    <abstract>Uniform procedures for the measurement of power frequency electric and magnetic fields from alternating current (ac) overhead power lines and for the calibration of the meters used in these measurements are established in this standard. The procedures apply to the measurement of electric and magnetic fields close to ground level. The procedures can also be tentatively applied (with limitations, as specified in the standard) to electric fields near an energized conductor or structure.</abstract>
