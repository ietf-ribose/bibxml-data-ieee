abstract:
- content: The protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices
    using low data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency
    (RF) transmissions in a wire less personal area network (WPAN) were defined in
    IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006. In this revision, the market applicability of IEEE Std
    802.15.4 is extended, the ambiguities in the standard are removed, and the improvements
    learned from implementations of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006 are included.
