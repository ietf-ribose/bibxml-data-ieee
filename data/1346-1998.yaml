abstract:
  content: A standard methodology for the technical and financial analysis of voltage
    sag compatibility between process equipment and electric power systems is recommended.
    The methodology presented is intended to be used as a planning tool to quantify
    the voltage sag environment and process sensitivity. It shows how technical and
    financial alternatives can be evaluated. Performance limits for utility systems,
    power distribution systems, or electronic process equipment are not included.
