abstract:
  content: 'Electrical faults on transmission and distribution lines are detected
    and isolated bysystem protective devices. Once the fault has been cleared, outage
    times can be reduced if thelocation of the fault can be determined more quickly.
    This guide outlines the techniques andapplication considerations for determining
    the location of a fault on ac transmission and distributionlines. The document
    reviews traditional approaches and the primary measurement techniques usedin modern
    devices: one-terminal and two-terminal impedance-based methods and traveling wavemethods.
    Application considerations include: two- and three-terminal lines, series-compensatedlines,
    parallel lines, untransposed lines, underground cables, fault resistance effects,
    and otherpower system conditions, including those unique to distribution systems.'
