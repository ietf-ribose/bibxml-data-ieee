    <abstract>The world is witnessing a rapid advance in Stereoscopic 3D, and Ultra high definition (UHD) technology. As a result, the need for accurate quality and visual comfort assessment techniques to foster the display device industry as well as signal processing area. In this standard, thorough assessments with respect to the human visual system (HVS) for S3D and UHD contents shall be presented. Moreover, several image and video databases are also publicly provided for any research purpose.</abstract>
