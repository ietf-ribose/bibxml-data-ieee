abstract:
  content: This standard addresses a need for an openly defined, independent standard
    for controlling information exchange to and from personal health devices and managers
    (e.g. cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes).
    Interoperability is key to growing the potential market for these devices and
    enabling people to be better informed participants in the management of their
    health.
