    <abstract>Surge protective components (SPCs) used in power and telecom surge protective devices (SPDs) and equipment ports are covered in the IEEE C62.42(TM) guide series. This part, Part 3 of the series, describes silicon PN-Junction clamping diode SPCs and covers technology variants, including forward biased semiconductor diodes, Zener breakdown semiconductor diodes, avalanche breakdown semiconductor diodes, punch-through semiconductor bipolar junction transistor diodes, and fold-back semiconductor bidirectional transistor diodes, as well as component construction; characteristics; ratings; and application examples.</abstract>
