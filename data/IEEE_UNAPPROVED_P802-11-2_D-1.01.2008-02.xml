    <abstract>Recommended practices for evaluating and measuring the performance of IEEE Std 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) devices and networks at the component and application level are described. A set of performance metrics, measurement methodologies and test conditions are provided that enable such measurements to be made and permit prediction of the performance of installed WLAN devices and networks.</abstract>
