    <abstract>This standard covers instructions for conducting and reporting the more generally applicable and acceptabletests to determine the performance characteristics of single-phase induction motors. It is not intended thatthis standard shall cover all possible tests used in production or tests of a research nature. The standardshall not be interpreted as requiring the making of any or all of the tests described herein in any giventransaction.</abstract>
