abstract:
  content: Information to assist in determining the electrical parameters of communication
    and control cables necessary to improve the overall reliability of these cables
    when used in high-voltage environments is the objective of this standard. There
    should be a very high probability (greater than 99%) that these cables will perform
    their intended function for specified periods of time in high-voltage interference
    conditions. The end result being more reliable communications over said cables.
    The information presented in this standard will apply equally to either new or
    existing [already installed] cables.
