    <abstract>This standard addresses the central control room of a nuclear power generating station and the overall complex in which this room is housed. The purpose of this standard is to provide guidance for the design of the nuclear power plant control room complex, which must meet applicable design criteria. Requirements are established and recommendations are offered to aid the designer in meeting the applicable general design criteria.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
