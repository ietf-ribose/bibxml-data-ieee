    <abstract>The framework for the reliability prediction for electronic hardware is covered in this standard. This standard identifies required elements for an understandable and credible reliability prediction with information to evaluate the effective use of the prediction results. A reliability prediction generated according to this standard shall have sufficient information concerning inputs, assumptions, data sources, methodology(ies), and uncertainties so that the risk associated with using the prediction results can be considered. This document does not provide instructions for how to perform reliability prediction and does not judge methodologies.</abstract>
