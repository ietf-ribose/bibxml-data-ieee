    <abstract>Data messages, known as Protocol Data Units (PDUs), that are exchanged on a network among simulation applications are defined. These PDUs are for interactions that take place within specified domains called protocol families, which include Entity Information/Interaction, Warfare, Logistics, Simulation Management, Distributed Emission Regeneration,Radio Communications, Entity Management, Minefield, Synthetic Environment, Simulation Management with Reliability, Information Operations, Live Entity Information/Interaction, and Non-Real-Time protocol.</abstract>
