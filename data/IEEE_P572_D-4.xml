    <abstract>This standard provides criteria for qualification of commonly- used Class 1E connection assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations. The proposed revision will address (1) current qualification methodology and technologies, (2) digital technology effects on connector qualification, (3) EMI/RFI environmental factors, and (4) consistency with IEEE Std 323-2004.</abstract>
