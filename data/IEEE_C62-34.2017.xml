    <abstract>This standard applies to surge protective devices designed for application on the low-voltage supply mains (1000 V rms and less, frequency between 48 Hz and 62 Hz) and intended to be connected at locations between, and including, the secondary terminals of the distribution transformer and the line side of the service equipment. Such surge protective devices are also known as secondary arresters. This is coordinated with IEEE Std C62.44 (the application guide),NEC Article 285, and ANSI/UL 1449.</abstract>
