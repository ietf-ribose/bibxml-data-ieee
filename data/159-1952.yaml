abstract:
  content: In setting up test procedures for radiation counter tubes, it is necessary
    to consider not only the test circuits but also the physical arrangements of test,
    such as nature of source, distance between source and counter, scattering by objects
    near the source or counter, shielding of the counter against unwanted radiations,
    and the background due to cosmic rays and general contamination. The relative
    importance of these various factors will depend on the type of counter under test
