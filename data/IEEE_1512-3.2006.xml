    <abstract>Revision of IEEE Std 1512.3-2002. This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about public safety issues involved in transportation-related events, through common incident management message sets. The message sets specified are consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1 or ASN) syntax. This standard comprises one companion volume of the family of incident management standards centered around a base standard: IEEE Std 1512-2006. Other members of that family include other companion volumes, specifying incident management message sets for transportation management-related data exchange and hazardous-material and public safety data exchange. Collectively, that family of standards shall be referred to as the IEEE 1512 Family of Standards. The goal of that family of standards is to support efficient communication for the real-time, interagency management of transportation-related events. Those events include incidents, emergencies, accidents, planned roadway closures, special events, and disasters caused by humans or natural events. Those events include any such event that impacts transportation systems or that causes a report to be received by an emergency management system, whether the event actually affects a transportation system and whether a response is required.</abstract>
