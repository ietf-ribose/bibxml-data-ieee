  content: Withdrawn Standard. Supplement to the IEEE 802.12 Demand Priority Access
    Method allowing optional implementation of redundant links to facilitate automatic
    recovery of network connectivity in case of link or repeater failure anywhere
    in the network path are specified. Rules for connecting redundant links within
    a network are defined.
