    <abstract>The Management Information Base (MIB) module specifications for IEEE Std 802.3, also known as Ethernet, are contained in this standard. It includes the Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2) MIB module specifications formerly produced and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the Guidelines for the Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO) MIB modules formerly specified within IEEE Std 802.3, as well as extensions resulting from amendments to IEEE Std 802.3. The SMIv2 MIB modules are intended for use with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), commonly used to manage Ethernet.</abstract>
