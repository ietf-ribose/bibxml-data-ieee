    <abstract>A method for sizing both vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries used in terrestrial photovoltaic (PV)systems is described.Installation,maintenance,safety,testing procedures,and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this document.Recom- mended practices for the remainder of the electrical systems associated with PV installations are also beyond the scope of this document.</abstract>
