abstract:
  content: Link Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to
    form a Link Aggregation Group, such that a Media Access Control (MAC) Client can
    treat the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end, it
    specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links,
    consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating
    at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent Link Aggregation
    capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support
    link aggregation.
