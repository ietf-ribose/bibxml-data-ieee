    <abstract>This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access control layer(MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint broadbandwireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is structured to supportmultiple physical layer (PHY) specifications, each suited to a particular operational environment.The standard enables rapid worldwide deployment of innovative, cost ffective, and nteroperable multivendor broadband wireless access products, acilitates competition in roadband access by providing alternatives to wireline broadband ccess, encourages onsistent worldwide spectrum allocations, and accelerates the ommercialization of broadband ireless access systems. The standard is a revision of IEEEE Std 02.16-2004, and onsolidates material from IEEE Std 802.16eTM-2005, IEEE 802.16 004/Cor1-2005, IEEE 02.16fTM-2005, and IEEE Std 802.16gTM-2007, along with additional maintenance items and nhancements to the management information base specifications. This revision supersedes nd makes obsolete IEEE Std 802.16-2004 and all of its subsequent amendments and orrigenda.</abstract>
