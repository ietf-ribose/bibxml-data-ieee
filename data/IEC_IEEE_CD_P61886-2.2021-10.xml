    <abstract>Use of electrical power on the seabed is increasing. Both within the oil and gas and renewable industries there is an increasing use of electrical power equipment on the seabed. Subsea processing activities like compression and pumping require an increasingly higher amount of electrical power. Power generation, whether onshore or offshore requires development of equipment both for subsea transmission and distribution. This standard includes requirements related to equipment installed below the sea surface. The objective of this standard is to substitute project/client specific specifications are used both for design and testing.</abstract>
