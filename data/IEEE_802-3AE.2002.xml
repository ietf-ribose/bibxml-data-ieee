    <abstract>Support to extend the IEEE 802.3 protocol and MAC specification to an operating speedof 10 Gb/s. Several Physical Coding Sublayers known as 10GBASE-X, 10GBASE-R, and10GBASE-W are specified, as well as significant additional supporting material for a 10 GigabitMedia Independent Interface (XGMII), a 10 Gigabit Attachment Unit Interface (XAUI), a 10 GigabitSixteen-Bit Interface (XSBI) and management. (An Interpretation for this standard is available at http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/interps/802.3ae-2002_interp.pdf)</abstract>
