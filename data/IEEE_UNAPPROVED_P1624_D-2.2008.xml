    <abstract>This document presents a Standard that defines the reliability capability of organizations and identifies the criteria for assessing the reliability capability of an organization. This Standard is intended to be usable by all organizations that design, manufacture or procure electrical/electronics components or products. Although the concepts described in this Standard could be applied to both hardware and software products, the focus of the standard is on hardware products.</abstract>
