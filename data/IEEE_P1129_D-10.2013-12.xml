    <abstract>This document describes the recommended practice for online monitoring of large synchronous generators. Contained within this document are high-level discussions of each of the proposed monitoring methods, and recommended threshold values, whenever there is a general agreement on those values. The present standard does not include instrumentation that is clearly understood to belong to the protection scheme of the generator (e.g.: differential protection).</abstract>
