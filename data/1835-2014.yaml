abstract:
- content: This standard was prepared to assist personnel responsible for maintenance
    painting of above-grade electrical support structures for electric utilities and
    large industrial facilities. The standard provides procedures to (1) assess structures
    for atmospheric corrosion; (2) assess the level of risk to the structure in terms
    of corrosion attack and degradation to the existing coating system; (3) make informed
    decisions based on those findings as to whether coating repair is needed, and
    if so, to what extent; and (4) apply repair coatings to the structure if applicable.
    This standard applies to the repair of above-grade atmospheric coatings and serves
    as a resource for preparing specifications to achieve the successful coating of
    utility structures.

- content: This standard provides a procedure that shall be used to (1) assess structures
    for atmospheric corrosion; (2) assess the level of risk to the structure in terms
    of corrosion attack and degradation to the existing coating system; (3) make informed
    decisions based on those findings as to whether coating repair is needed and if
    so, to what extent; and (4) apply repair coatings to the structure if applicable.
    This standard applies to the repair of above-grade atmospheric coatings. For the
    purposes of this standard, the atmospheric area to be coated is generally comprised
    of that portion of the utility support structure above the transition zone. This
    standard is limited to the above-grade and atmospheric portions of utility support
    structures. It does not address below-grade coating repair within and below the
    transition zone. This standard does not address foundations or guy anchoring systems.
    This standard does not cover the coating of aluminum, weathering steel, concrete,
    or any material other than steel. Likewise, it does not cover the coating of non-support
    structures such as fencing, buildings, transformers, or other miscellaneous components
    within the transmission, distribution, and substation systems. This standard does
    not cover new construction, transition zone, below-grade, or water immersion.
    These areas of concern are addressed specifically in other NACE/IEEE standards.
    This standard does not address mechanical or structural damage, mechanical or
    structural repairs, or structural integrity.
