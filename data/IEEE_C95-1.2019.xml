    <abstract>Safety limits for the protection of persons against the established adverse health effects of exposures to electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields in the frequency range 0 Hz to 300 GHz are presented in this standard. These exposure limits are intended to apply generally to persons permitted in restricted environments and to the general public in unrestricted environments. These exposure limits are not intended to apply to the exposure of patients by or under the direction of physicians and medical professionals, as well as to the exposure of informed volunteers in medical or scientific research studies, and might not be protective with respect to the use of medical devices or implants.</abstract>
