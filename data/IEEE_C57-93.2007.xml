    <abstract>This guide provides guidance and recommended practices on the installation and maintenance of liquid-immersed power transformers rated 501 kVA and above with secondary voltages of 1000 V and above. This guide covers the entire range of power transformers, including extra high voltage (EHV) transformers. This guide does not cover special transformers such as furnace transformers, rectifier transformers etc. Distinctions are made as required for various MVA ratings, voltage ratings, and types of liquid insulation.</abstract>
