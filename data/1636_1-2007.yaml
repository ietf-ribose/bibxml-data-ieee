abstract:
  content: This standard is intended to promote and facilitate interoperability between
    components of an automatic test system (e.g., between test executive and diagnostic
    reasoner)where test results need to be shared. The standard thus facilitates the
    capture of test results data in storage devices and databases, facilitating online
    and offline analysis. The test results schema becomes a class of information that
    can be used within the SIMICA family of standards.
