    <abstract>This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective functions of:1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices2) direct-acting overcurrent electronic trip systems3) reverse-current trip systems4) undervoltage trip devicesthat are integral with low-voltage ac (635V and below) and general purpose low-voltage dc (600V and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE Std C37.13(TM), IEEE Std C37.14(TM), and IEEE Std C37.16(TM).Additional information, communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions or devices are not covered by this standard. This standard should not be interpreted to restrict theinclusion of such functionality in the device.</abstract>
