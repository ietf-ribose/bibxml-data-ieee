  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This standard sets forth the requirements for installation, inspection, and testing of Class I and Class IE electric power, instrumentation, and control equipment and systems during the construction phase of a nuclear power generating station. These requirements are intended to assure that only materials and equipment of acceptable quality are incorporated into the plant, that quality is maintained and quality workmanship prevails throughout the construction process, and that completed installations conform to specified requirements, so as to promote public safety, prevent accidents and mitigate the consequences of accidents if they occur, and provide a high degree of plant reliability.</abstract>
