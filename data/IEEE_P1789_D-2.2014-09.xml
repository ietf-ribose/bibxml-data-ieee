    <abstract>Definition of the concept of modulation frequencies for LEDs; a discussion on their applications to LED lighting; a describe LED lighting applications in which modulation frequencies pose possible health risks to users are addressed in this recommended practice. A discussion on the concept of dimming of LEDs by modulating the frequency of driving currents/voltage and present recommendations for modulation frequencies (flicker) for LED lighting and dimming applications to help protect against known potential adverse health effects is also addressed.</abstract>
