    <abstract>Guidelines are established for the verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&amp;A) of distributed interactive simulation (DIS) exercises. “How-to” procedures for planning and conducting DIS exercise VV&amp;A are provided. Intended for use in conjunction with IEEE Std 1278.3-1996, this recommended practice presents data flow and connectivity for all proposed verification and validation activities and provides rationale and justification for each step. VV&amp;A guidance is provided to exercise users/sponsors and developers.</abstract>
