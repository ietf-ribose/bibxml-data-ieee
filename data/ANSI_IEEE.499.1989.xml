    <abstract>A recommended practice for electric drives and related electrical equipment for installation in the cement industry is set forth. The recommendations apply to all electric drives and include motors, controls, and control wiring associated with machinery or equipment commonly used in the manufacturing areas of cement plants, but they do not apply to power distribution circuits. The intent is to promote safety for personnel and equipment, maximum reliability with minimum loss of production, reduced maintenance and increased life of equipment, clarification of needs and conditions to reduce special engineering and chance of error in specification, and overall economy.</abstract>
