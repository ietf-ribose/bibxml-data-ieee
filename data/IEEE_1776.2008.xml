    <abstract>A test procedure (Combination of IEEE Std 275<sup>TM</sup>-1992 and IEEE Std 429<sup>TM</sup>-1994) for comparing two or more insulation systems in accordance with their expected life at rated temperature is outlined. The procedure is limited to insulation systems for alternating-current (AC) electrical machines using form-wound pre-insulated stator coils rated 15 000 V and below.</abstract>
