    <abstract>The terms and definitions covered in this standard refer to all high -voltage enclosed and non-enclosed, indoor and outdoor air switches rated in excess of 1000 V used primarily in connection with generation, transmission, distribution, and conversion of electric power. This includes such switch types as disconnect, horn gap, fault initiation, and ground for manual or power operation. The following switch types are not covered by this standard: distribution cutouts fitted with disconnecting blades, and switches used in metal enclosed and pad mounted switchgear. This standard also does not apply to load break separable insulated connectors, circuit breakers, circuit switchers, or reclosers.</abstract>
