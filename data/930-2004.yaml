abstract:
- content: This guide describes, with examples, statistical methods to analyze times
    to break down and breakdown voltage data obtained from electrical testing of solid
    insulating materials, for purposes including characterization of the system, comparison
    with another insulator system, and prediction of the probability of breakdown
    at given times or voltages

- content: Replaced by IEC 62539 Ed.1 (2007-07). This guide describes, with examples,
    statistical methods to analyze times to breakdown and breakdown voltage data obtained
    from electrical testing of solid insulating materials, for purposes including
    characterization of the system, comparison with another insulator system, and
    prediction of the probability of breakdown at given times or voltages.
