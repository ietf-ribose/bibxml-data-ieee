    <abstract>Information is provided for selecting the proper circuit breaker for 1 a particular application. This recommended practice helps the application engineer specify the type of circuit breaker, ratings, trip functions and accessories. It also discusses circuit breakers for special applications, e.g., instantaneous only and switches. In addition, it provides information for applying circuit breakers at different locations in the power system, and for protecting specific components.</abstract>
