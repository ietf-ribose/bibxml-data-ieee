    <abstract>This standard applies to all AC high-voltage generator circuit breakers rated on a symmetrical current basis, with rated maximum voltage 15.8 kV and above with a continuous current rating of 6.3 kA and above that are applied to generator terminals. Pumped storage installations are considered a special application, and their requirements are not completely covered by this standard</abstract>
