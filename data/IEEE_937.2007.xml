    <abstract>Design considerations and procedures for storage, location, mounting, ventilation, assembly, and maintenance of lead-acid secondary batteries for photovoltaic (PV) power systems are provided. Safety precautions and instrumentation considerations are also included. Even though general recommended practices are covered, battery manufacturers may provide specific instructions for battery installation and maintenance.</abstract>
