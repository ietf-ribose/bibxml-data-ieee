abstract:
  content: A uniform method is established for determining the temperature classification
    for the insulation systems for open-wound, solid-cast and resin-encapsulated power
    and distribution transformers by testing rather than by chemical composition.
    These insulation systems are intended for use in transformers covered by IEEE
    Std C57.12.01(TM) and IEEE Std C57.12.91(TM) as they apply to dry-type transformers
    whose highest voltages exceed nominal 600 V.
