    <abstract>In this IEEE standard general recommendations for loading 65/spl deg/C rise mineral-oil-immersed distribution and power transformers are covered. Recommendations for 55/spl deg/C rise transformers are included in an annex because a substantial percentage of these transformers are still in service. Applications of loads in excess of nameplate rating involve some degree of risk. It is the purpose of this guide to identify these risks and to establish limitations and guidelines, the application of which will minimize the risks to an acceptable level.</abstract>
