    <abstract>This standard defines the parameters to be used in the identification of contact wires used in transit systems and electric railways and railroads. This standard is intended for use in identifying contact wire by metallurgical content, electrical conductivity and agency ownership. This standard is not intended to replace or supersede existing identification standards using grooving but rather to simplify identification methods.</abstract>
