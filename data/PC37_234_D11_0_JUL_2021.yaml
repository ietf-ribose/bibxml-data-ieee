abstract:
  content: This guide discusses principles of power bus protection. It addresses availability
    and location of breakers, current sensing devices, and disconnect switches as
    well as bus configurations and switching schemes and their impact on the selection
    and application of bus protection. Bus protection schemes are presented, and their
    characteristics, strengths, and limitations are examined. Bus protection applications
    are presented.
