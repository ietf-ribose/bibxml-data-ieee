    <abstract>Directions and requirements are provided for the conversion of qualified power switchgear equipment. Examples such as low-voltage power circuit breakers; high-voltage outdoor, and medium-voltage indoor drawout power circuit breakers; medium-voltage fused contactors; medium-voltage ground and test devices; medium-voltage fused load interrupter switches; and metal-enclosed switchgear are covered in this standard. Existing design standards are referenced with appropriate guidance on design testing necessary to design-verify the conversions. Reconditioning, which concerns the maintenance of existing equipment without alteration, is not covered.</abstract>
