    <abstract>A test procedure (Combination of IEEE Stds. 275-1992   429-1994 ) for comparing two or more insulation systems in accordance with their expected life at rated temperature is outlined. The procedure is limited to insulation systems for alternating-current (ac) electrical machines using form-wound pre-insulated stator coils rated 15000 V and below.</abstract>
