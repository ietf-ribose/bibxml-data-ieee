    <abstract>EME2-AES and XCB-AES wide-block encryption with associated data (EAD) modes of the NIST AES block cipher, providing usage guidelines and test vectors, are described. A wide block encryption algorithm behaves as a single block cipher with a large plaintext input and ciphertext output, but uses a narrow block cipher [in this case Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)] internally. These encryption modes are oriented toward random access storage devices that do not provide authentication, but need to reduce the granularity of a potential attack.</abstract>
