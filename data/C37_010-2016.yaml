abstract:
- content: The application of indoor and outdoor high-voltage circuit breakers rated
    above 1000 Vac for use in commercial, industrial, and utility installations is
    covered in this guide. It deals with usage under varied service conditions, temperature
    conditions affecting continuous current compensation, reduced dielectrics, reclosing
    derating as applicable, calculation of system short-circuit current, compensation
    at different X/R ratios, detailed calculations with application curves, out-of-phase
    switching, and general application.
