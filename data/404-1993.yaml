  content: 'SUPERSEDED BY 404-2000 / NOT AVAILABLE TO RESELLERS. Errata sheet is available
    online: http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/errata/404-1993.pdf This standard establishes
    electrical ratings and test requirements for cable joints for use with extruded
    dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 5000--138 000
    V and cable joints for use with laminated dielectric cable rated in preferred
    voltage steps from 2500--500 000 V. It also defines a variety of common joint
    constructions. This standard is designed to provide uniform testing procedures
    that can be used by manufacturers and users to evaluate the ability of underground
    power cable joints to perform reliably in service.'
