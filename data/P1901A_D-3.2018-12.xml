    <abstract>Physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of a broadband powerline communication technology called flexible channel wavelet PHY/MAC (FCW) for Internet of Things applications (IoTPLC) based on wavelet orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (wavelet OFDM) are specified in this amendment. Modes for operations in different channels (frequency bands) with different values of carrier spacing are defined.</abstract>
