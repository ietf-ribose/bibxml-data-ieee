    <abstract>The XES standard defines a grammar for a tag-based language whose aim is to provide designers of information systems with a unified and extensible methodology for capturing systems behaviors by means of event logs and event streams. This standard includes a XML Schema describing the structure of an XES event log/stream and a XML Schema describing the structure of an extension of such a log/stream. Moreover, the standard includes a basic collection of so-called XES extension prototypes that provide semantics to certain attributes as recorded in the event log/stream.</abstract>
