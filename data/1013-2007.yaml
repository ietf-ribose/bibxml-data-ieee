abstract:
  content: A method for determining the energy-capacity requirements (sizing) of both
    vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries used in terrestrial stand-alone
    photovoltaic (PV) systems is described. Sizing batteries for hybrid or grid-connected
    PV systems is beyond the scope of this document. Installation, maintenance, safety,
    testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are
    beyond the scope of this document. Recommended practices for the remainder of
    the electrical systems associated with PV installations are also beyond the scope
    of this document.
