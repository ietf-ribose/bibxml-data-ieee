    <abstract>Requirements for direct acting current and voltage protective functions of direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices, direct-acting overcurrent electronic trip systems, reverse-current trip systems for dc circuit breakers, and undervoltage trip devices that are integral with low-voltage ac (1000 V and below) and general purpose low-voltage dc (1500 and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE Std C37.13<sup>TM</sup>, IEEE Std C37.14<sup>TM</sup>, and IEEE Std C37.16<sup>TM</sup> are included in this standard. Additional information, communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions or devices are not covered (but also not restricted) by this standard.</abstract>
