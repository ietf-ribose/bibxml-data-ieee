abstract:
  content: This guide applies to the use of 50 Hz and 60 Hz shunt power capacitor
    units rated 2400 Vac and above, and assemblies of such capacitors. Included are
    guidelines for the application, protection, and ratings of equipment for the safe
    and reliable utilization of shunt power capacitors. The guide is general and intended
    to be basic and supplemental to specific recommendations of the manufacturer.
    The guide covers applications that range from simple capacitor unit utilization
    to complex capacitor bank situations.
