    <abstract>Guidance for the design of the dc auxiliary power systems for nuclear and large fossil-fueled power generating stations is provided. The components of the dc auxiliary power system, including lead storage batteries, static battery chargers, and distribution equipment, are addressed. Guidance for selecting the quantity and types of equipment, the equipment ratings, interconnections, instrumentation, control and protection is also provided.</abstract>
