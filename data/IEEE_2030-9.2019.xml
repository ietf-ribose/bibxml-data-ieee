    <abstract>The factors that should be taken into account for planning and designing microgrids are covered in this recommended practice. It provides approaches and good practices to be considered in the planning and design, including system configuration, electrical system design, safety, power quality monitoring and control, electric energy measurement and scheme evaluation. This recommended practice applies to ac microgrids that can be either grid-connected or standalone microgrids.</abstract>
