    <abstract>Recommended practice for Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) is described. The DSEEP is intended as a high-level process framework into which the lower-level systems engineering practices native to any distributed simulation user can be easily integrated. Simulation architectures include Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level Architecture (HLA), and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).</abstract>
