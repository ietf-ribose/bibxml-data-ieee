    <abstract>This document provides general guidelines 1 on the preparation of a functional specification for a solid-state electronic shunt device used to compensate voltage fluctuation. The guide covers devices rated to Medium Voltage (1kVâ€“35kV). The device contains in general: an inverter, rectifier or DC converter, energy storage device, and coupling transformer. The device typically is connected in parallel with the network using a coupling transformer.</abstract>
