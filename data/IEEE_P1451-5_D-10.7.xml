    <abstract>This project will establish a standard for wireless communication methods and data format for transducers (sensors and actuators). The standard will define a TEDS based on the IEEE 1451 concept, and protocols to access TEDS and transducer data. It will adopt necessary wireless interfaces and protocols to facilitate the use of technically differentiated, existing wireless technology solutions. It will not specify transducer design, signal conditioning, wireless system physical design or use, or use of TEDS.</abstract>
