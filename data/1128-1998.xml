    <abstract>" Realistic and repeatable criteria, as well as recommended test methods, for characteriz-ing the absorption properties of typical anechoic chamber linings applied to a metallic surface aredescribed. Parameters and test procedures are described for the evaluation of RF absorbers to beused for radiated emissions and radiated susceptibility testing of electronic products, in the ab-sorber manufacturer and/or absorber user environment, over the frequency range of 30 MHz to5 GHz."</abstract>
