abstract:
  content: 'IEEE 1848 provides a set of practical methods for helping to manage the
    levels of risks due to electromagnetic (EM) disturbances throughout the lifecycles
    of electronic equipment. These risks include the consequences of all types of
    errors, malfunctions or failures in products, equipment and systems that employ
    modern electronic technologies (i.e. in hardware and/or software). It supplements
    the work done in creating IEC 61000-1-2:2016 (Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
    - Part 1-2: General - Methodology for the achievement of functional safety of
    electrical and electronic systems including equipment with regard to electromagnetic
    phenomena) by providing requirements for detailed practical techniques and measures
    for helping to manage risks (not just functional safety) that could be caused
    by EM disturbances. These techniques and measures would be used in the management,
    specification, design, implementation, verification and validation, and through-life
    operation, maintenance, repair, refurbishment, upgrading, and eventual dismantling
    for disposal of equipment and systems employing digital electronic systems, for
    both hardware and software (firmware).'
