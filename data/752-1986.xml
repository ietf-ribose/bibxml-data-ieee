    <abstract>This standard provides brief descriptions of applicable tone address signaling techniques and definitions of the related signaling parameters that affect performance. The classes of instruments intended to measure the parameters presented are described. Details are provided on the techniques necessary to perform these measurements, and performance and operating requirements for the test equipment that will satisfy this standard.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
