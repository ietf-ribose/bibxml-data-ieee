abstract:
  content: This standard is for synchronized phasor measurement systems in power systems.
    It defines a synchronized phasor (synchrophasor), frequency, and rate of change
    of frequency (ROCOF) measurements. It describes time tag and synchronization requirements
    for measurement of all three of these quantities. It specifies methods for evaluating
    these measurements and requirements for compliance with the standard under both
    static and dynamic conditions. It defines a phasor measurement unit (PMU), which
    can be a stand-alone physical unit or a functional unit within another physical
    unit. This standard does not specify hardware, software, or a method for computing
    phasors, frequency, or ROCOF.
