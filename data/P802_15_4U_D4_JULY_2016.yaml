abstract:
  content: This amendment defines a PHY layer enabling the use of the 865-867 MHz
    band in India. The supported data rate should be at least 40 kb/s per second and
    the typical Line of Sight (LOS) range should be on the order of 5 km using omni
    directional antenna. Included are any channel access and/or timing changes in
    the MAC necessary to support this PHY layer.
