    <abstract>The standard establishes a set of processes by which organizations can include consideration of human ethical values throughout the stages of concept exploration and development. This standard supports management and engineering in transparent communication with selected stakeholders for values elicitation and prioritization. It involves traceability of ethical values through an operational concept, value propositions, and value dispositions in the system design. The standard describes processes that provide for traceability of ethical values in the concept of operations, ethical requirements, and ethical risk-based design. It is applicable for all sizes and types of organizations using their own life cycle models.</abstract>
