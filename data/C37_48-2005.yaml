abstract:
- content: Information on the application, operation and maintenance of high-voltage
    fuses (above 1000 V and through 169 W), distribution enclosed single-pole air
    switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for use on ac distribution
    systems is provided. These include enclosed, open, and open-link types of distribution
    cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses; distribution enclosed
    single-pole air switches; power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor
    and indoor fuse disconnecting switches; fuse supports, mountings, and links, all
    of the type used exclusively with the above; and removable switch blades for certain
    products among the above

- content: Information on the application, operation and maintenance of high-voltage
    fuses (above 1,000 V and through 169 kV), distribution enclosed single-pole air
    switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for use on ac distribution
    systems is provided. These include enclosed, open, and open-link types of distribution
    cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses; distribution enclosed
    single-pole air switches; power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor
    and indoor fuse disconnecting switches; fuse supports, mountings, and links, all
    of the type used exclusively with the above; and removable switch blades for certain
    products among the above. This guide is one of a series of complimentary standards
    so arranged that this guide plus two other standards apply to all devices, while
    one or more of the other standards provides additional specifications for a particular
    device. For each device, IEEE Std C37.40-2003 and IEEE Std C37.41-2000 plus the
    standard(s) covering that device constitute a complete set of standards for each
    device. In addition to this application, operation and maintenance guide which
    covers all of the above devices, additional operation, classification, application,
    and coordination information for current-limiting fuses can be found in IEEE Std
    C37.48.1-2002, a "tutorial" style document.
