    <abstract>The requirements in this standard are applied to 50 Hz and 60 Hz, two-pole and four-pole, cylindrical-rotor synchronous generators driven by steam turbines and/or by combustion gas turbines. The drive may be direct or through a gearbox or other device that permits different speeds for the turbine and the generator. The generators covered by this standard are to have rated outputs of 10 MVA and above.</abstract>
