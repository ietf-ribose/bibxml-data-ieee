    <abstract>IEEE-45-8 is a member of the IEEE 45 Series and associated with eight sub-documents (IEEE-45.1 through 45.8). Although intended to provide a consensus of recommended practices for cable systems on shipboard, this document may also be of benefit for information purposes in the proper selection and installation of wire and cable in commercial or military coastal vessels, or offshore drilling and production platforms. These cables include low voltage cables, medium voltage cables, and specialty cables.</abstract>
