abstract:
  content: Superseded. Methods and requirements for qualifying continuous duty Class
    1E motors for use in nuclear power generating stations are provided. The methods
    are used for qualifying motors, extending the qualification, and updating the
    qualification if the motorâ€™s design or specified service conditions are modified.
    The requirements include the principles, procedures, and methods of qualification
    as they relate to continuous duty Class 1E polyphase squirrel cage AC motors.
