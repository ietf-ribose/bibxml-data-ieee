    <abstract>Methods for determining the reliability of 724 continuous power systems in industrial and commercial facilities are described in this recommended practice. The method of reliability analysis by probability methods is described first. This is followed by a discussion of how to evaluate the results and how to implement changes to ensure that the expected degree of reliability is achieved.</abstract>
