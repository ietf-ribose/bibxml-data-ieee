abstract:
  content: Information that is useful in constructing an open-area test site (OATS)
    used to perform radiated emission measurements in the frequency range of 30-1000
    MHz is provided. Final validity of the test site can only be made by performing
    site attenuation measurements as described in ANSI C63.4-2003.
