    <abstract>Methodologies for determination of the steady-state winding hottest-spot temperature in dry-type distribution and power transformers with ventilated,scaled, solid cast,and encapsulated windings built in accordance with IEEE std C57.12.01 and IEC 60726 are described in this guide. Converter transformers are not included in this guide.</abstract>
