  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">The standard applies to wires and cables, used principally for power system communications and control purposes, which are located within electric power stations or are installed within the zone of influence of the power station ground potential rise (GPR), or which may be buried adjacent to electric power transmission and distribution lines. They may be subjected to high voltages either by conduction or induction coupling, or both. Such voltages are often higher than the insulation withstand capability of ordinary telephone-type cables, which are frequently used for such purposes. The standard covers the appropriate design requirements, electrical and mechanical parameters, the testing requirements, and the handling procedures for cables that are to be installed and operated in high voltage environments. Coaxial and fiber optic cables are specifically excluded from this standard. The objective of this standard is to specify a cable that may be used to ensure the overall reliability of communications and control cables in high voltage environments.</abstract>
