abstract:
  content: Specification and test procedures for a single-axis interferometric fiber
    optic gyro (IFOG) for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement
    measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. The test procedures
    are derived from those presently used in the industry.
