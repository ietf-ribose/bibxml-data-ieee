    <abstract>This standard provides fundamental definitions for general use in time domain pulse technology. It defines terms for pulse phenomena and pulse parameters which are prerequisite to: efficient communication of technical information; standards for methods of pulse parameter measurement; standards for pulse apparatus; and standards for apparatus which employs pulse techniques. With its scope, the object of this standard is the definition of an internally consistent, mathematically rigorous, and general set of pulse terms which are applicable to: hypothetical and practical pulses regardless of accuracy or precision; to a wide range of technologies and disciplines; and, in a measurement situation, regardless of the means of measurement or the means for waveform evaluation employed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
