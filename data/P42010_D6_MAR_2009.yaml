abstract:
  content: '"This International Standard addresses the creation, analysis and sustainment
    of architectures of systems through the use of architecture descriptions. A conceptual
    model of architecture description is established. The required contents of an
    architecture description are specified. Architecture frameworks are introduced
    for codifying conventions and common practices of architecture description within
    a community. The content of an architecture framework is specified. Annexes provide
    the motivation and background for key concepts and terminology and examples of
    applying this International Standard. "'
