    <abstract>A guide to the application of composite insulators to overhead transmission and distribution lines is provided. It is based on utility field experience, results of research aboratory tests, and manufacturers recommendations. The guide deals with composite insulators, which include a core, weathersheds, and metal end fittings. The core consists of resin and axially-aligned glass fibres. The weathersheds are of polymeric materials.</abstract>
