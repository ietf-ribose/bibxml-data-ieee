    <abstract>Superseded by 836-2001. A guide to the conduct and analysis of precision centrifuge tests of linear accelerometers is provided, covering each phase of the tests beginning with the planning. Possible error sources and typical methods of data analysis are addressed. The intent is to provide those involved in centrifuge testing with a detailed understanding of the various factors affecting accuracy of measurement, both those associated with the centrifuge and those in the data collection process. Model equations are discussed, both for the centrifuge and for a typical linear accelerometer, each with the complexity needed to accommodate the various identified characteristics and error sources in each. A new iterative matrix equation solution for deriving from the centrifuge test data the various model equation coefficeints for the accelerometer under test is presented.</abstract>
