  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">The standard sets forth the requirements for a calibration program to control and verify the accuracy of measuring and test equipment used to ensure that safety systems of a nuclear facility are in conformance with prescribed technical requirements and that data provided by testing, inspection, or maintenance are valid. These requirements also cover modifications and those activities occurring during the operating phase that are comparable in nature and extent to related activities occurring during the initial construction of the facility.&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ETX&amp;gt;&amp;gt;</abstract>
