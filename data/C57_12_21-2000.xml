    <abstract>This standard covers certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics and takes into consideration certain safety features of single-phase, 60 Hz, mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, padmounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers with high-voltage bushings. These transformers are rated 167 kVA and smaller, with high-voltages of 34500 GRD/19900 volts and below for operation between one phase and grounded neutral, and low-voltage of 240/120 volts. These transformers are generally used for step-down purposes from an underground primary cable supply. NOTEâ€”Refer to latest federal regulations concerning polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminations in transformers.</abstract>
