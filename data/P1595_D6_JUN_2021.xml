    <abstract>Optical phase conductor (OPPC) is a phase conductor with optical fibers for telecommunication purposes. This standard covers the performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria for an OPPC. Functional requirements, such as electrical, mechanical, optical fiber, environmental, and packaging, and test requirements related to design, 4 installation, in-service, and maintenance, including routine tests, are covered.</abstract>
