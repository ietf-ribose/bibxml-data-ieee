    <abstract>Vented lead-acid (VLA), valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), and nickel-cadmium (NiCd) stationary battery installations are discussed in this guide, written to serve as a bridge between the electrical designer and the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) designer. Ventilation of stationary battery installations is critical to improving battery life while reducing the hazards associated with hydrogen production. This guide describes battery operating modes and the hazards associated with each. It provides the HVAC designer with the information to provide a cost effective ventilation solution.</abstract>
