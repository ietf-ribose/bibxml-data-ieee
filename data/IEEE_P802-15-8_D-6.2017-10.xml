    <abstract>Physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) mechanisms are defined in this standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) peer aware communications (PAC) optimized for peer-to-peer and infrastructure-less communications with fully distributed coordination. PAC features include discovery for peer information without association, discovery signaling rate typically greater than 100 kb/s, discovery of the number of devices in the network, scalable data transmission rates typically up to 10 Mb/s, group communications with simultaneous membership in multiple groups typically up to 10, relative positioning, security, and operation in selected globally available unlicensed/licensed bands below 11 GHz capable of supporting these requirements.</abstract>
