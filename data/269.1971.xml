    <abstract>The purpose of this standard is to describe a practical method for measuring the transmission characteristics of a telephone set by means of objective measurements in a test connection. The test results thus obtained may be used as a means of evaluating or specifying the transmission performance of a telephone on a standardized basis. The basic accuracy and reproducibility of measurements made in accordance with this standard will depend primarily upon the accuracy of the test equipment used, the care with which the measurements are conducted, and the inherent stability of the telephone and/or transducers under test. Where a given set of measurements is repeated in the same laboratory and by the same operator, a relatively high degree of reproducibility should normally be obtained. However, when comparing measurements made by different laboratories, allowances must be made for the influencing factors mentioned above.</abstract>
