abstract:
  content: This standard establishes the minimum requirements for processes for Configuration
    Management (CM) in systems and software engineering. The application of this standard
    applies to any form, class, or type of software or system. This revision of the
    standard expands the previous version to explain CM, including identifying and
    acquiring configuration items, controlling changes, reporting the status of configuration
    items, as well as software builds and release engineering. Its predecessor defined
    only the contents of a software configuration management plan. This standard addresses
    what CM activities are to be done, when they are to happen in the life cycle,
    and what planning and resources are required. It also describes the content areas
    for a CM Plan. The standard supports ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2008 and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288:2008 and adheres to the terminology in ISO/IEC/IEEE Std 24765 and the information
    item requirements of IEEE Std 15939TM
