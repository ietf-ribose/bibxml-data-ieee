abstract:
- content: The intent of this Test Procedure is to establish a uniform method by which
    the life of electronics transformer insulation systems can be compared. Thermal
    degradation is generally one of the major factors affecting the life of most insulating
    materials. It was chosen to be the major environmental factor in this Test Procedure.
    Other environmental factors, such as vibration,thermal shock, and moisture, have
    been included to simulate operating conditions. These factors have been chosen
    in such a way as to develop and disclose promptly any significant weaknesses during
    the temperature aging of an insulation system.
