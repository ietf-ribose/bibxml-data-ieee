    <abstract>Information to assist users of gaskets in evaluating gasket measurement techniques to determine which exhibit the properties critical to the intended application, to highlight limitations and sources of error of the competing measurement techniques, and to provide a basis for comparing the techniques is provided in this guide. Emphasis is placed on those measurement techniques that have been adopted through incorporation into standards, both commercial and military, or that have been used extensively.</abstract>
