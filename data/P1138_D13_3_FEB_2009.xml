  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">is standard covers the performance, test requirements, procedures and acceptance criteria for a transmission line overhead ground wire (a.k.a. shield wire,static wire,earth wire,skywire) with optical fibers commonly known as Optical Ground Wire (OPGW). An OPGW cable has the dual performance functions of a ground wire with telecommunicatons capabilities. This standard includes functional requirements such as electrical,mechanical,optical fiber,environmental and packaging; test requirements related to design, installation,in-service, maintenance, including routine tests. This standard is not intended to supersede any established safety rules,codes,regulations or practices associated with the use of OPGW cables.It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.</abstract>
