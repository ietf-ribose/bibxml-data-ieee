    <abstract>A method is provided for specifying power intent for an electronic design, for use in verification of the structure and behavior of the design in the context of a given power management architecture, and for driving implementation of that power-management architecture. The method supports incremental refinement of power intent specifications required for IP-based design flows.(The PDF of this standard is available to you at no cost thru the IEEE GET program https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=80)</abstract>
