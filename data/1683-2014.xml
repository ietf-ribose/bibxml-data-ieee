  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">Functional design recommendations and field practices for motor control centers (single- and three-phase 50 Hz and 60 Hz and dc) are provided in this guide. The features and practices described in this guide are intended to help reduce the probability that an incident will occur due to shock or arc flash hazards when qualified persons are performing certain activities. The recommendations within this guide are intended to augment the existing requirements of applicable standards for motor control centers, e.g., NEMA ICS 18 Motor Control Centers, UL 845 Motor Control Centers, NMX-J-353-ANCE, and CSA C22.2 No. 254. This guide also provides recommendations for interface relationships between the specifier, manufacturer, installer, and user for safety-related concerns. It also provides a framework from which specifiers/users can select specific MCC features and system characteristics that are applicable to their specific situation and needs.The recommendations in this guide complement safety requirements and procedures as stipulated by workplace safety standards and site practices and site procedures, e.g., NFPA 70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, CSA Z462 Workplace Electrical Safety Standard, site practice on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), etc.</abstract>
