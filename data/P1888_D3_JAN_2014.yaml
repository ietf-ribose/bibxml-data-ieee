abstract:
  content: 'The standard identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data storages
    for archiving and developing data sharing platform, and application units to be
    important system components for developing digital communities: i.e., building-scale
    and city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure. The standard defines
    a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways,
    storages, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks. This enables integration
    of multiple facilities, data storages, application services such as central management,
    energy saving, environmental monitoring and alarm notification systems.'
