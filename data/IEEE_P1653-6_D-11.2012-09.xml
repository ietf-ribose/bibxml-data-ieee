    <abstract>This document covers the grounding of dc equipment enclosures installed in dc traction power distribution facilities as well as related insulation treatments required for solid and resistance grounding methods. Guidelines are also given for material, installation, and testing of insulation used in dc traction facilities and further provides recommended criteria for acceptability. System grounding, though related, is not covered in this document.</abstract>
