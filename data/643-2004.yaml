abstract:
- content: The purpose of this guide is to provide application information to users
    of carrier equipment as applied on power transmission lines. Since the major applications
    of the power-line carrier (PLC) is for protective relaying, special consideration
    for these applications has been included. Information related to the expanding
    usage of carriers on distribution lines below 69 W is not specifically covered.
    Detailed equipment design information is avoided as this is primarily the concern
    of equipment manufacturers
