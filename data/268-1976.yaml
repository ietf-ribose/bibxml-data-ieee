abstract:
- content: This standard describes the International System of Units (SI), the modern
    version of the metric system. It includes listings of the base units, supplementary
    units, and units derived therefrom. Guidance is provided on application of the
    SI prefixes, other units in use with SI (including units accepted for limited
    use and units to be abandoned), and unit selection. A section on style and usage
    covers the writing of unit symbols and names, pronunciation, and recommendations
    for numbers. Extensive guidance is provided on conversion and rounding including
    tables for conversion of linear dimensions, also pressure and stress, along with
    a very extensive table of conversion factors. An appendix provides background
    information in the development of SI.
