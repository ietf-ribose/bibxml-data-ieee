abstract:
- content: The requirements in this standard are applied to 50 Hz and 60 Hz, two-pole
    and four pole, cylindrical-rotor synchronous generators driven by steam turbines
    and/or by combustion gas turbines. The drive may be direct or through a gearbox
    or other device that permits different speeds for the turbine and the generator.
    The generators covered by this standard are to have rated outputs of 10 MVA and
    above.
