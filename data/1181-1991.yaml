abstract:
  content: Recommendations are provided for the layout and test methods required to
    characterize properly latchup behavior in CMOS and BiCMOS integrated circuit processes
    or other processes that have similar lateral PNPN topographical layout characteristics.
    The aim is to allow the characterization of an integrated circuit process architecture
    so that different approaches can be scientifically compared. This allows the evaluation
    of the process capabilities on a 'worst-case' recommended structure and test method
    independent of actual integrated circuit product topographical latchup layout
    practices. Test structures and test philosophy are covered.<<ETX>>
