    <abstract>The architecture of a distributed, platform-independent system that manages removable media, including both disk and tape, using robotic and manual methods are specified. The general schema for managing media, the components of the software system, and the supporting data model used by the software system for managing this media are described by this standard. Details of major components of the system are specified by companion standards.</abstract>
