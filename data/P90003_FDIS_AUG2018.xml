    <abstract>This document provides guidance for organizations in the application of ISO 9001:2015 to the acquisition, supply, development, operation and maintenance of computer software and related support services. This document does not add to or otherwise change the requirements of ISO 9001:2015. The guidelines provided in this document are not intended to be used as assessment criteria in quality management system registration/certification. The application of this document is appropriate to software that is: part of a commercial contract with another organization, a product available for a market sector, used to support the processes of an organization, embedded in a hardware product, or related to software services. Some organizations may be involved in all the above activities; others may specialize in one area. Whatever the situation, the organizationâ€™s quality management system should cover all aspects (software related and non-software related) of the business. This document identifies the issues that should be addressed and is independent of the technology, life cycle models, development processes, sequence of activities and organizational structure used by an organization. Additional guidance and frequent references to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 software engineering standards are provided to assist in the application of ISO 9001:2015, in particular ISO/IEC/ IEEE 12207:2017.</abstract>
