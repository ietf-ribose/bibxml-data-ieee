    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE Std 334-2006 Methods and requirements for qualifying continuous duty Class 1E motors for use in nuclear power generating stations are provided. The methods are used for qualifying motors, extending the qualification, and updating the qualification if the motor's design or specified service conditions are modified. The requirements include the principles, procedures, and methods of qualification as they relate to continuous duty Class 1E polyphase squirrel cage ac motors.</abstract>
