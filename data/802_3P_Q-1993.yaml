  content: 'Abstract for IEEE 802.3-1993: This supplement to ISO/IEC 8802-3 : 1993
    [IEEE Std 802.3,1993 Edition] defines a set of mechanisms that enable management
    of ISO/IEC 8802-3 10 MWs integrated Medium Attachment Units (MAUs). The managed
    objects within this standard are defined as sets of attributes, actions, notifications,
    and behaviors in accordance with IEEE 802.1 and IS0 standards for network management.
    Abstract for IEEE 802.3q-1993: Changes are made to Section 5, Lower Management,
    of ISO/IEC 8802-3 : 1993 [IEEE Std 802.3,1 993 Edition] to bring it into alignment
    with ISO/IEC 10165-4, Guidelines for the development of managed objects (GDMO).'
