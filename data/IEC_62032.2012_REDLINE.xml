    <abstract>Theory, application of phase-shifting transformers, and the difference of specification and testing to standard system transformers are described in this guide. Various types of phase-shifting transformers and how to select the optimal design to achieve required control of power flow are covered. An understanding of the terminology, types, construction, and testing specific to phase-shifting transformers is provided.</abstract>
