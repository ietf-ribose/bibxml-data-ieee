  content: Since CASE adoption is a subject of the broader technology transition problem,
    this Technical Report addresses the adoption practices appropriate for a wide
    range of computing organisations. This Technical Report neither dictates nor advocates
    particular development standards, software processes, design methods, methodologies,
    techniques, programming languages, or life-cycle paradigms.
