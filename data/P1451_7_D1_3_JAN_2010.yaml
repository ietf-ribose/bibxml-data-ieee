abstract:
  content: This standard introduces data formats designed to facilitate communications
    between Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems and smart RFID tags with
    integral transducers (sensors and actuators). The standard defines new Transducer
    Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) formats for smart RFID tags, based on the IEEE 1451
    family of standards. This standard also defines a comprehensive command set for
    smart RFID tags.
