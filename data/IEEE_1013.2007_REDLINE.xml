    <abstract>A method for determining the energy-capacity requirements (sizing) of both vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries used in terrestrial stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems is described. Sizing batteries for hybrid or grid-connected PV systems is beyond the scope of this document. Installation, maintenance, safety, testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this document. Recommended practices for the remainder of the electrical systems associated with PV installations are also beyond the scope of this document.</abstract>
