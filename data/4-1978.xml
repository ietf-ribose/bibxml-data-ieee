    <abstract>This IEEE standard establishes standard methods of measurement of HV and basic testing techniques for application to all types of apparatus. The first section defines terms and presents general requirements regarding tests. Section 2 defines terms relating to the specific tests and describes methods for generation and measurement of voltages and currents. Section 3 provides definitions of terms related to the measurements. Section 4 provides information on measuring systems. Finally section 5 looks at the use of the sphere gap for the measurement of peak value.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
