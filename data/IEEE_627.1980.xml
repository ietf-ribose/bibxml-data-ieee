    <abstract>Basic principles for design qualification of safety systems equipment used in nuclear power generating stations are provided. Specification criteria, the development of a qualification program, and documentation are addressed. All types of safety systems equipment--mechanical and instrumentation as well as electrical--are covered. Principles and procedures for preparing specific safety systems equipment standards are established.</abstract>
