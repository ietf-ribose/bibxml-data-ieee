abstract:
  content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    (POC) medical device communication (MDC), this amendment extends the nomenclature
    defined by the base ISO/IEEE Std 11073-10101:2004 nomenclature standard. It includes
    significant extensions to support haemodynamics, respiration, ventilation and
    anesthesia monitoring, blood gas, urine, fluid-related metrics, and neurology,
    as well as units of measurements and measurement sites. It also captures and provides
    formal definitions for observation identifiers used by the IEEE 11073 Personal
    Health Device standards and additional attributes for reporting their regulatory
    and certification status. It also defines information attributes to support alert
    communication and accurate medical device time synchronization and timekeeping.
