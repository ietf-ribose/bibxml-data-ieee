    <abstract>This amendment to IEEE Std 802-2014 provides an optional local MAC address space structure, known as the Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP), to allow multiple administrations to coexist. This structure designates a range of local MAC addresses for protocols using a Company ID (CID) assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority. Another range of local MAC addresses is designated for assignment by administrators. The amendment recommends a range of local MAC addresses for use by IEEE 802 protocols.</abstract>
