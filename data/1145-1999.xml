    <abstract>Safety precautions, installation design considerations, and procedures for receiving, storing, commissioning, and maintaining pocket- and fiber-plate nickel-cadmium storage batteries for photovoltaic (PV) power systems are provided. Disposal and recycling recommendations are also discussed. This recommended practice applies to all PV power systems, regardless of size or application, that contain nickel-cadmium battery storage subsystems.</abstract>
