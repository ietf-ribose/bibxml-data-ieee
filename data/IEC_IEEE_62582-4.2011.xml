    <abstract>This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 specifies methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using oxidation induction techniques in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements for sample preparation, the measurement system and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results. The different parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 are measurement standards, primarily for use in the management of ageing in initial qualification and after installation. Part 1 of IEC/IEEE 62582 includes requirements for the application of the other parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 and some elements which are common to all methods. Information on the role of condition monitoring in the qualification of equipment important to safety is found in IEEE Std 323.</abstract>
