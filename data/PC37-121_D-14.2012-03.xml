    <abstract>This Guide for Switchgear-Unit Substation-Requirements is intended for use as the basis for the coordination of equipment in Unit Substations by assisting in the selection of components. A variety of designs for unit substations are possible using various combinations of incoming sections, transformer sections, outgoing sections, and transition sections. It is intended that the incoming, outgoing, transformer, and transition sections included in a unit substation meet the basic requirements of applicable industry standards for those sections. This guide covers three-phase unit substations for step-down operation in the range of 112.5 kVA or greater at primary voltages of 601 V through 38 kV.</abstract>
