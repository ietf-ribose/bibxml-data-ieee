    <abstract>The continuing expansion and modernization program in the cement industry has placed an increasing importance on the cement plant power distribution system. Increasing plant capacity accompanied by larger kilns, grinding mills, crushers, and the increasing use of automatic controls has placed greater stress on the adequacy and reliability of the distribution system. Safety,capacity, reliability, and low maintenance - all at a reasonable cost - are the requirements ofthe cement plant power distribution system.</abstract>
