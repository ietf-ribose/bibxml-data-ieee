    <abstract>Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00(TM) and other standards applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers are described. Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. Resistance measurements, polarity and phase-relation tests, ratio tests, no-load loss and excitation current measurements, impedance and load loss measurements, dielectric tests, temperature tests, short-circuit tests, audible sound level measurements, and calculated data are covered in this standard.</abstract>
