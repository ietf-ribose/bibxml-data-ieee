abstract:
  content: The measurement of thermal resistivity of soil and backfill materials to
    include concrete, engineered backfills, grout, rock, sand, and any other material
    used to encase the cable system installed in the ground is covered in this guide.
    A thorough knowledge of the thermal properties of a soil or backfill material
    enables the user to properly design, rate, and load underground cables. The method
    used is based on the theory that the rate of temperature rise of a line heat source
    is dependent upon the thermal constants of the medium in which it is placed. The
    designs for both laboratory and field thermal probes are also described in this
    guide.
