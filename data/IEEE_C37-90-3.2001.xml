    <abstract>This standard describes test procedure, test point selection, test level, and acceptance criteria for repeatable electrostatic discharge immunity evaluations for tabletop and floor-standing protective relay equipment. Simulator characteristics for hand/metal ESD testing are specified for both the air and contact discharge methods. This standard has been harmonized with other ESD standards where consensus could be reached.</abstract>
