abstract:
  content: Definitions and explanations of key concepts in the fields of spectrum
    management, spectrum trading, cognitive radio, dynamic spectrum access, policy-based
    radio systems, software defined radio, and related advanced radio system technologies
    are provided. Beyond simple, short definitions, amplifying text explaining these
    terms in the context of the technologies that use them is provided. Also described
    is how these technologies interrelate and create new capabilities while at the
    same time providing mechanisms supportive of new spectrum management paradigms.
