    <abstract>The design and operation of a dc microgrid for rural or remote applications based on extra low voltage dc (ELVDC) to reduce cost and simplify stability are discussed in this standard. Such microgrids are typically operated without connecting to a nationâ€™s electric power system.</abstract>
