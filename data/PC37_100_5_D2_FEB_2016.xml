    <abstract>The terms and definitions in the standard are intended to encompass the products within the scope of the C37 series of standards that include power switchgear for switching, interrupting, metering, protection, and regulating purposes as used primarily in connection with generation, transmission, distribution, and conversion of electric power. The definitions of terms and explanatory notes relating thereto contained in this standard are not intended to embrace all possible meanings of the terms. They are intended for the sole purpose of establishing only those meanings of terms used in switchgear standards. They do not purport to embrace other meanings that the terms may properly have when used in connection with other subjects. In some instances, terms and definitions that are not identical to those in this standard have been developed by other branches of industry. Where this situation exists, the definitions in this standard shall be used for power switchgear within the C37 series of standards. This is mostly a copy of the existing scope of the C37.100 standard, and also mimics some of the information in the existing PAR draft purpose</abstract>
