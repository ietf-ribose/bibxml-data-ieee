    <abstract>A method of calculating the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead lines, given the weather conditions, is presented. Along with a mathematical method, sources of the values to be used in the calculation are indicated. This standard does not undertake to list actual temperature-ampacity relationships for a large number of conductors nor does it recommend appropriately conservative weather conditions for the rating of overhead power lines. It does, however, provide a standard method for doing such calculations for both constant and variable conductor current and weather conditions.</abstract>
