    <abstract>This standard provides protocols for measurement and control networks for home and residential quarters so that they can achieve green, smarter functions. It specifies the interactive data format between devices and systems; and it gives standardized definitions of the sensor, actuator, and equipment, together with the data communication processes. This standard also includes: The data format definition for configuration and management-oriented functions; The data format definition for deployment and control-oriented functions; The method definition for conformance tests and interoperability tests.</abstract>
