    <abstract>Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device communication, a normative definition of the communication between personal body composition analyzer agents and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set-top boxes) is established by this standard in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments to restrict optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication functionality for personal telehealth body composition analyzers.In this context, the phrase “body composition analyzer” is used broadly to cover analyzing devices that measure body impedances and compute the various body components including body fat from the impedance.</abstract>
