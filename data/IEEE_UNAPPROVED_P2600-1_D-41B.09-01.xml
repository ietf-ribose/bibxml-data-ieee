    <abstract>Standard for a Protection Profile for Hardcopy Devices in a restrictive commercial information processing environment in which a relatively high level of document security, operational accountability, and information assurance, are required. Typical information processed in this environment is trade secret, mission-critical, or subject to legal and regulatory considerations such as for privacy or governance. This environment is not intended to support life-critical or national security applications. This environment will be known as "Operational Environment A."</abstract>
