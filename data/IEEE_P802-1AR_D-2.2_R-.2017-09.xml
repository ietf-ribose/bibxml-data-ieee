    <abstract>A Secure Device Identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device and supports authentication of the device s identity. Locally significant identities can be securely associated with an initial manufacturer-provisioned DevID and used in provisioning and authentication protocols to allow a network administrator to establish the trustworthiness of a device and select appropriatepolicies for transmission and reception of data and control protocols to and from the device.</abstract>
