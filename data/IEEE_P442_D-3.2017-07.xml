    <abstract>The measurement of thermal resistivity of soil and backfill materials to include concrete, engineered backfills, grout, rock, sand, and any other material used to encase the cable system installed in the ground is covered in this guide. A thorough knowledge of the thermal properties of a soil or backfill material enables the user to properly design, rate, and load underground cables. The method used is based on the theory that the rate of temperature rise of a line heat source is dependent upon the thermal constants of the medium in which it is placed. The designs for both laboratory and field thermal probes are also described in this guide.</abstract>
