abstract:
  content: Safety limits for the protection of persons against the established adverse
    health effects of exposures to electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields
    in the frequency range 0 Hz to 300 GHz are presented in this standard. These exposure
    limits are intended to apply generally to persons permitted in restricted environments
    and to the general public in unrestricted environments. These exposure limits
    are not intended to apply to the exposure of patients by or under the direction
    of physicians and medical professionals, as well as to the exposure of informed
    volunteers in medical or scientific research studies, and might not be protective
    with respect to the use of medical devices or implants.
