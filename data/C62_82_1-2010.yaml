abstract:
- content: The procedure for selection of the withstand voltages for equipment phase-to-ground
    and phase-to-phase insulation systems is specified. A list of standard insulation
    levels, based on the voltage stress to which the equipment is being exposed, is
    also identified. This standard applies to three-phase ac systems above 15 kV.
