    <abstract>A method is provided for specifying a common interoperable format for electronic systems design. The format provides a common way to specify information/data about the project management, netlists, components, design rules, and geometries used in the large-scale integration-package-board designs. The method provides the ability to make electronic systems a key consideration early in the design process; design tools can use it to seamlessly exchange information/data.</abstract>
