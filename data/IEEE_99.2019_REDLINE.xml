    <abstract>A general form for the preparation of test procedures is provided in this standard. Points to be considered by technical committees in the preparation of specific instructions for the thermal evaluation of insulation systems for electric equipment are suggested. The test procedures involve accelerated thermal aging of insulation systems and specify tests that the committees deem pertinent based on conditions of use. The objective of the procedures is to provide for the functional evaluation, by test, of insulation systems for electric equipment.</abstract>
