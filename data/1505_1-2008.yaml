abstract:
  content: 'This standard represents an extension to the IEEE 1505 receiver fixture
    interface (RFI) standard specification. Particular emphasis is placed on defining
    within the IEEE 1505 RFI standard a more specific set of performance requirements
    that employ a common scalable: (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific connector
    modules; (c) respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation; and
    (e) legacy automatic test equipment (ATE) transitional devices. This is intentionally
    done to standardize the footprint and assure mechanical and electrical interoperability
    between past and future automatic test systems (ATS).'
