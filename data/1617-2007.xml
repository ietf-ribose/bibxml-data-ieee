    <abstract>This guide provides a summary of the methods for detection, mitigation, and control of concentric neutral corrosion in medium-voltage, unjacketed, underground distribution cable installed direct buried or in conduit. The causes of corrosion in cable concentric neutral wires and straps and the methods available to detect this corrosion are described. The purpose of the concentric neutral and the consequences of significant loss of the concentric neutral are discussed. Recommendations are made for the mitigation and control of the cable concentric neutral corrosion.</abstract>
