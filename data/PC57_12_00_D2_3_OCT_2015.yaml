abstract:
  content: 'Electrical and mechanical requirements for liquid-immersed distribution
    and power transformers, and auto transformers and regulating transformers; single-
    and polyphase, with voltages of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding,
    are set forth. This standard is a basis for the establishment of performance,
    and limited electrical and mechanical interchangeabilityrequirements of equipment
    are described; it is also a basis for assistance in the proper selectionof such
    equipment. The requirements in this standard apply to all liquid-immersed distribution,power,
    and regulating transformers except the following: instrument transformers, step
    voltageand induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers,
    specialtytransformers, grounding transformers, mobile transformers, and mine transformers.'
