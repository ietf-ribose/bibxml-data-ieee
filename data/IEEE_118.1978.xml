    <abstract>Methods of measuring electrical resistance that are commonly used to determine the characteristics of electric machinery and equipment are presented. The methods are limited to those using direct-current or commercial power frequencies of 60 Hz or below, and to those measurements required to determine performance characteristics. The choice of method in any given case depends on the degree of accuracy required and the nature of the circuit to be measured; a guide for selecting the appropriate method is given.</abstract>
