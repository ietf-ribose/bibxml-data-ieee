    <abstract>A family of commercially feasible ways for new systems to perform binary floating-point arithmetic is defined. This standard specifies basic and extended floating-point number formats; add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, remainder, and compare operations; conversions between integer and floating-point formats; conversions between different floating-point formats; conversions between basic-format floating-point numbers and decimal strings; and floating-point exceptions and their handling, including nonnumbers.</abstract>
