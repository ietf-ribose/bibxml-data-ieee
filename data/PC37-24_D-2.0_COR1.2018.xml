    <abstract>This corrigendum corrects an error where the user of this document was directed to gather the wrong column information from the NOAA website for use in calculations. The document erroneously directs the user to read from the monthly normal average temperature values from the website rather than the monthly normal maximum temperature values.</abstract>
