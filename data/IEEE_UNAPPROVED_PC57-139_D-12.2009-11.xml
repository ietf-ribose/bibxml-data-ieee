    <abstract>This guide discusses and recommends methods of testing and evaluating dissolved gasses in mineral based transformer oils found in Load Tap Changers (LTCs). General types of LTC mechanisms, breathing configurations and electrical design will be included as evaluation criteria in determining when mechanical damage or failure has occurred. Dissolved Gas of the LTC is required. This guide will not be manufacturer specific, rather category specific.</abstract>
