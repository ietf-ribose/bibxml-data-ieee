abstract:
  content: This standard provides a framework for introducing nanomaterials such as
    graphene into large scale, high volume manufacturing in established semiconductor
    factories (fabs). Since semiconductor fabs must incorporate practices that maintain
    high yields, there are very strict requirements for how manufacturing is performed.
    Nanomaterials represent a potential contaminant in semiconductor fabs, and must
    be introduced in a structured and methodical way.
