    <abstract>This standard applies to all liquid-immersed distribution, power and regulating transformers that are designed to operate at temperatures that exceed the normal thermal limits of C57.12.00, under continuous load, in the designed average ambient and at rated conditions. This standard provides specific requirements and guidance in the design, testing and application of the transformers covered within its scope. These transformers incorporate high-temperature insulation systems or systems that use a combination of high-temperature and conventional insulation.</abstract>
