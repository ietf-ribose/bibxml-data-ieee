    <abstract>Utilizing terminology as established in IEEE Std 2755-2017, defined and classified in this guide are approximately 150 features and functions across five core areas of technology capability in the family of new technology products collectively referred to as Intelligent Process Automation. This guide is published to create clarity for individuals involved with Software-Based Intelligent Process Automation products so that industry participants may rely on a product manufacturerâ€™s functionality claims and understand the underlying technological methods used to produce those functions and how one might approach evaluating the relative sophistication and importance of each function or feature. This guide represents the consensus of a diverse panel of industry participants.</abstract>
