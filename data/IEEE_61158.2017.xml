    <abstract>IEEE Std 61158(TM) is an adoption of the EPSG DS 301, Ethernet POWERLINK--Communication Profile Specification. Ethernet POWERLINK is a communication profile for Real-Time Ethernet (RTE). It extends Ethernet according to IEEE Std 802.3(TM) with mechanisms to transfer data with predictable timing and precise synchronisation. The communication profile meets timing demands typical for high-performance automation and motion applications. It does not change basic principles of the Fast Ethernet Standard IEEE Std 802.3 but extends it towards RTE. Thus it is possible to leverage and continue to use any standard Ethernet silicon, infrastructure component, or test and measurement equipment like a network analyzer.</abstract>
