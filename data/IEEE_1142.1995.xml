    <abstract>The user of underground cables is provided with information on the design, testing, and application of moisture-impervious, medium-voltage, solid dielectric power cable using metal-plastic laminates as moisture barriers. Information is also provided on selection of jacketing materials and installation practices. Other types of moisture barriers, such as extruded metal sheaths and bare metallic tapes with sealed seams, are beyond the scope of this guide.</abstract>
