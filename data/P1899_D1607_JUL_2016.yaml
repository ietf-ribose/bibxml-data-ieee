abstract:
  content: This guide focuses on the AC/DC substation control equipment, pole control
    equipment, protection equipment, auxiliary secondary equipment of high-voltage
    direct-current (HVDC) transmission systems. Based on analyzing the existing HVDC
    transmission projects, this guide gives specifications for structure, configuration,
    performance and test of HVDC control and protection equipment, which could be
    applied to HVDC transmission system with the voltage range up to and including
    800 kV.
