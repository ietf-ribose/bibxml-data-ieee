    <abstract>The proper treatment of the electrical elements of the backplane that provides a physical and electrical connection between different modules in a computer system is covered. Techniques for measuring impedance, capacitance, and crosstalk are provided; and crosstalk, ground bounce, and decoupling are discussed. Relationships among the key elements controlling backplane performance, such as driver and receiver characteristics, the distance of the driver and receiver from the backplane, the impedance of the bus traces treated as transmission lines, lumped elements such as connectors and vias, and the termination are examined.</abstract>
