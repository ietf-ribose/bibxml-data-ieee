    <abstract>This standard is applicable to bushings intended for use in high-voltage circuit breakers and gas-insulated switchgear. These bushings are intended for indoor and outdoor use, operating on alternating current with a rated voltage greater than 1000 V and a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. These bushings are usually a part of an apparatus and tested according to the apparatus of which they form part.</abstract>
