    <abstract>The purpose of this guide is to provide application information to users of carrier equipment as applied on power transmission lines. Since the major applications of the power-line carrier (PLC) is for protective relaying, special consideration for these applications has been included. Information related to the expanding usage of carriers on distribution lines below 69 W is not specifically covered. Detailed equipment design information is avoided as this is primarily the concern of equipment manufacturers</abstract>
