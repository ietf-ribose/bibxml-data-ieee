    <abstract>Supplemental information for a high-speed serial bus that integrates well with most IEEE standard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses is specified. It is intended to extend the usefulness of a low-cost interconnect between external peripherals. This standard follows the IEEE Std 1212-2001 command and status register (CSR) architecture.</abstract>
