    <abstract>Promoting and facilitating interoperability between components of automatic test systems where test results need to be shared is addressed in this standard. The standard thus facilitates the capture of test results data in storage devices and databases, facilitating online and offline analysis. The test results schema becomes a class of information that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards. The exchange format is expressed in both the OWL and XML formats.</abstract>
