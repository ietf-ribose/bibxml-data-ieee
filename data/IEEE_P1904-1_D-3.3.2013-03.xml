    <abstract>This standard describes the system-level requirements needed to ensure service-level, multi-vendor interoperability of Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON) equipment. The specifications complement the existing IEEE Std 802.3 and IEEE Std 802.1 standards which ensure the interoperability at the Physical layer and Data Link layer. Specifically included in this specification are: -- EPON system-level interoperability specifications covering equipment functionality, traffic engineering, and service-level QoS/CoS mechanisms; --Management specifications covering: equipment management, service management, and EPON power-saving mechanism</abstract>
