    <abstract>The grounding and bonding of equipment in industrial and commercial power systems is covered in this recommended practice. The interconnection and grounding of the non-electrical metallic elements of a system is covered first. This is followed by a discussion of the objectives of equipment grounding and bonding, including minimizing electric shock hazard to personnel, providing adequate current carrying capability for ground faults, and ensuring the timely operation of overcurrent protection.</abstract>
