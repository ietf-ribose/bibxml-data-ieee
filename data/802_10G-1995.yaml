abstract:
  content: A security label option that can be used to implement rule-based access
    controls for the protection of IEEE 802 local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan
    area networks (MANs) is defined. Information carried by security labels can be
    used to control access, specify protective measures; and identify handling restrictions
    required by a communications security policy. This standard specifies the syntax
    for the label and basic processing rules. Other information, such as label semantics
    and additional processing requirements unique to a security policy, can be specified
    via registration.
