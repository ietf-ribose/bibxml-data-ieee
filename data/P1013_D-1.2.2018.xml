    <abstract>A method for determining the energy-capacity requirements (sizing) of both vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries used in terrestrial stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems is described in this recommended practice. Sizing batteries for hybrid or grid-connected PV systems is beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Installation, maintenance, safety, testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Recommended practices for the remainder of the electrical systems associated with PV installations are also beyond the scope of this recommended practice.</abstract>
