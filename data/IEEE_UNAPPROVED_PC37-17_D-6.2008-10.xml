    <abstract>This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective functions of:<br/><br/>1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices<br/>2) direct-acting overcurrent electronic trip systems<br/>3) reverse-current trip systems<br/>4) undervoltage trip devices<br/><br/>that are integral with low-voltage ac (635V and below) and general purpose low-voltage dc (600V and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE Std C37.13, IEEE Std C37.14, and IEEE Std C37.16.<br/><br/>Additional information, communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions or devices are not covered by this standard. This standard should not be interpreted to restrict the inclusion of such functionality in the device.</abstract>
