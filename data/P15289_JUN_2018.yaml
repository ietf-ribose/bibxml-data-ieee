  content: The purpose and content of all identified systems and software life cycle
    and service management information items (documentation) are specified in this
    document. The information item contents are defined according to generic document
    types (description, plan, policy, procedure, report, request, and specification)
    and the specific purpose of the document. This document provides a mapping of
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 clauses with a set of information
    items. This document identifies records and information items based on analysis
    of references in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, which in
    some cases provide partial or complete outlines for the content of specific documents.
    Information items may be combined or subdivided as needed for project or organizational
    purposes.
