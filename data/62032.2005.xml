    <abstract>Theory, application of phase-shifting transformers, and the difference of specification and testing to standard system transformers are described. Various types of phase-shifting transformers and how to select the optimal design to achieve required control of power flow are covered. An understanding of the terminology, types, construction, and testing specifical to phaseshifting transformers is provided.</abstract>
