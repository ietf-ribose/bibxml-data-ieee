    <abstract>Methods for designing 110 kV to 1000 kV ac overhead transmission lines are provided and may also be used as reference for the design of lower voltage overhead transmission lines. The principles and procedures for designing weather-resistant conductor, ground wire, insulator, structure, and foundation of ac transmission overhead lines are specified.</abstract>
