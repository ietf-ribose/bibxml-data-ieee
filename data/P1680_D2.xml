  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">SystemVerilog 1800 is a Unified Hardware Design, Specification and Verification language. Verilog 1364-2005 is a design language. Both standards were approved by the IEEE-SASB in November 2005. This standard creates new revisions of the Verilog 1364 and SystemVerilog 1800 IEEE standards, which include Errata fixes and resolutions; enhancements; Enhanced assertion language; Merge of Verilog LRM and SystemVerilog 1800 LRM into a single LRM; Integration with AMS; and insures interoperability with other languages such as SystemC and VHDL.</abstract>
