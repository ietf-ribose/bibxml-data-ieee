    <abstract>Activities related to short-circuit analysis, including design considerations for new systems, analytical studies for existing systems, as well as operational and model validation considerations for industrial and commercial power systems are addressed. Fault current calculation and device duty evaluation is included in short-circuit analysis. Accuracy of calculation results primarily relies on system modeling assumptions and methods used. The use of computer-aided analysis software with a list of desirable capabilities recommended to conduct a modern short-circuit study is emphasized. Examples of system data requirements and result analysis techniques are presented.</abstract>
