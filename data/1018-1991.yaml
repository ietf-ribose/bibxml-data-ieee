abstract:
  content: In this standard minimum requirements for the construction, manufacturing,
    purchasing, and application of electric submersible pump cable are presented.
    The cable is round or flat, with ethylene-propylene rubber insulation, nitrile
    jacket, and armor, and is rated for voltages not exceeding 3 kV or 5kV and for
    ambient temperatures not exceeding 284 degrees F. Conductors, insulation, barrier
    (optional), assembly and jacket, armor, requirements for testing by the manufacturer,
    and cable ampacity are covered.<<ETX>>
