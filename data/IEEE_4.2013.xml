    <abstract>Standard methods and basic techniques for high-voltage testing applicable to all types of apparatus for alternating voltages, direct voltages, lightning impulse voltages, switching impulse voltages, and impulse currents are established in this standard. Sections that deal with alternating voltage, direct voltage, and impulse testing are combined in this revision to organize the technical content for ease of use. In addition, the concept of measurement uncertainty in evaluation of high-voltage and high-current tests is introduced in this version.</abstract>
