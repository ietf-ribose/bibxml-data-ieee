abstract:
  content: This standard provides requirements for materials, test, performance, and
    manufacture of ground rod electrodes, and threaded and threadless ground rod couplings
    and clamps commonly used in overhead line construction. It applies to ground rod
    electrodes and ground rod couplings of copper or steel alloyed materials. Specifically
    included are ground rod electrodes of copper-coated steel, hot-dip galvanized
    steel and solid stainless steel for grounding applications.
