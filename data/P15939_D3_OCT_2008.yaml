abstract:
  content: This International Standard defines a measurement process applicable to
    system and software engineering and management disciplines. The process is described
    through a model that defines the activities of the measurement process that are
    required to adequately specify what measurement information is required, how the
    measures and analysis results are to be applied, and how to determine if the analysis
    results are valid. The measurement process is flexible, tailorable, and adaptable
    to the needs of different users. This International Standard identifies a process
    that supports defining a suitable set of measures that address specific information
    needs. It identifies the activities and tasks that are necessary to successfully
    identify, define, select, apply, and improve measurement within an overall project
    or organizational measurement structure. It also provides definitions for commonly
    used measurement terms. This international standard provides an elaboration of
    the measurement process from ISO/IEC 15288:2008 and IEEE Std 15288-2008, as well
    as ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and IEEE Std 12207-2008.
