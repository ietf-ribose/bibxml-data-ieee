    <abstract>This goal of this standard is to define and classify the components and functionality of adaptive instructional systems (AISs) as it is applied to individual learners. A conceptual model of AISs for team, collective and collaborative instruction will be the subject of a future standard. This standard also defines parameters used to describe AISs and establishes requirements and guidance for the use and measurement of these parameters. The expected outcome of this standardization project is an AIS conceptual model that describes AIS features, processes, and events for individual learners.</abstract>
