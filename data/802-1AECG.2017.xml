    <abstract>Ethernet Data Encryption devices (EDEs) are specified in this amendment. An EDE is a two-port bridge that uses MACsec to provide secure connectivity for attached customer bridges, or for attached provider bridges. EDEs may allow the customer (or provider) bridges to continue to use a VLAN Identifier (VID) in transmitted frames to select (as already specified in IEEE Std 802.1Q(TM)) between provider network or provider backbone network services.</abstract>
