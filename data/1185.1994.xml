    <abstract>Installation methods to improve cable installation practices in generating stations are provided. These include cable lubrication methods, conduit-cable pulling charts, pull rope selection criteria, pulling attachment methods, and alternative methods to traditional cable pulling tension monitoring. This guide supplements IEEE Std 422-1986 and IEEE Std 690-1984, which provide specific cable installation limits. This guide may also be of benefit to cable pulling crews in commercial and industrial facilities when similar cable types and raceways are used.</abstract>
