    <abstract>The impact of artificial intelligence or autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS) on humans is measured by this standard. The positive outcome of A/IS on human well-being is the overall intent of this standard. Scientifically valid well-being indices currently in use and based on a stakeholder engagement process ground this standard. Product development guidance, identification of areas for improvement, risk management, performance assessment, and the identification of intended and unintended users, uses and impacts on human well-being of A/IS are the intents of this standard.</abstract>
