abstract:
  content: This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective
    functions of:<br><br>1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices<br>2)
    direct-acting overcurrent electronic trip systems<br>3) reverse-current trip systems<br>4)
    undervoltage trip devices<br><br>that are integral with low-voltage ac (635V and
    below) and general purpose low-voltage dc (600V and below) power circuit breakers
    covered by IEEE Std C37.13, IEEE Std C37.14, and IEEE Std C37.16.<br><br>Additional
    information, communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions
    or devices are not covered by this standard. This standard should not be interpreted
    to restrict the inclusion of such functionality in the device.
