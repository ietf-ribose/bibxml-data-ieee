    <abstract>A suggested outline for information that should be included in a Design Criteria for overhead transmission lines is presented. This Guide is not a Design Criteria or a Design Manual, it is a listing of the information that is required during the design of a transmission line, and provides guidance for line designers in the collection and documentation of how the line was designed; including the sources of information used in design and the design approach used</abstract>
