    <abstract>Background on light flicker caused by fluctuations in power demands of variable loads is presented in this recommended practice. A flicker measurement method is presented using a meter that is completely described in IEC 61000-4-15. The short-term (Pst) and long-term (Plt) flicker indices used for the analysis of flicker data are defined. Flicker limits for various voltage levels are presented. An assessment procedure for evaluating flicker compliance against emission limits is described. Methodologies to analyze background flicker to identify the flicker contribution of single loads are also presented.</abstract>
