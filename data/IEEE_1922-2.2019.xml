    <abstract>Rules for the near real-time calculation of pollutant emissions allocated to the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure (servers, network, etc.) are specified in this standard. Emissions in this standard are defined as gaseous and particle emissions caused by the generation of electricity consumed during the ICT infrastructure use phase.</abstract>
