    <abstract>The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China has approved the 174-216 MHz, 407-425 MHz and 608-630 MHz bands for medical information transmission. China Medical Band (CMB) devices operating within these bands conform to a set of rules specified in China, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Doc: 423-2005, which restricts use of the band to only medical, non-voice use under direction of a healthcare practitioner, among other requirements. This standard defines a PHY for devices operating on Chinese approved bands for medical signals.</abstract>
