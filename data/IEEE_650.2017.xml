    <abstract>Methods for qualifying static battery chargers, inverters and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems for Class 1E installations outside containment in nuclear power generating stations are described in this standard. Similar electronic equipment for use in applications outside containment, where specific standards for such equipment are not available, may also be qualified using these methods. A combination of type testing and analysis, the latter including a justification of methods, theories, and assumptions used, are employed in the qualification methods set forth. Requirements of IEC/IEEE 60780-323 are met by these procedures.</abstract>
