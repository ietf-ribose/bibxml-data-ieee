abstract:
  content: Methods for defining the dc load and for sizing a lead-acid battery to
    supply that load for stationary battery applications in float service are described
    in this recommended practice. Some factors relating to cell selection are provided
    for consideration. Installation, maintenance, qualification, testing procedures,
    and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of
    this recommended practice. Design of the dc system and sizing of the battery charger(s)
    are also beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
