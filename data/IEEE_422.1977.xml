    <abstract>This document has been developed as a guide for the design and installation of wire and cable systems in generating stations with the objective of minimizing failures and their consequences. This guide is not intended for use in design considerations of wire and cable systems in switchyards or substations. Although the function of this document is a design guide, some of the problem solutions are presented in the wording of recommended practices. Users of the guide should be aware that the recommendations offered do not represent the only acceptable practices available for solution of the problems. They do represent principles and methods which are consistent with the goals of this guide.</abstract>
