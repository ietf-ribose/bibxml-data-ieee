    <abstract>This standard applies to single-phase instrument transformers of a nominal system voltage of 115 kV and above with capacitive insulation system for line-to-ground connection and for both indoor and outdoor application. This standard is intended for use as a supplement to IEEE Std C57.13 and as a basis for performance and safety of equipment. It also describes test sequences, criteria, methods and documentation for the test</abstract>
