abstract:
  content: Enhanced Queued Arbitrated (QA) Functions, which can support applications
    requiring bandwidth guarantees and delay limits on a DQDB subnetwork,are specified.
    Connection-Oriented Convergence Functions (COCFs) using the enhanced QA Functions,
    which are necessary to support connection-oriented service, are also specified.
