abstract:
  content: Superseded Uniform minimum acceptable requirements for the preparation
    and content of Software Quality Assurance Plans (SQAPs) are provided. The standard
    also provides a standard against which such plans can be compared and assessed.
    It applies to the development and maintenance of critical software. For noncritical
    software, or for software already developed, a subset of the requirements of this
    standard may be applied.
