    <abstract>Covered in the IEEE C62.42 guide series are surge protective components (SPCs) used in power and telecom surge protective devices (SPDs) and equipment ports. Covered in this standard on gas discharge tube (GDT) technology SPCs are the following: component construction, characteristics, ratings, and application examples. The application examples are given in two informative annexes covering: basic circuits and protection circuits specific to communications, local area networks, high frequency feeds, and industrial services.</abstract>
