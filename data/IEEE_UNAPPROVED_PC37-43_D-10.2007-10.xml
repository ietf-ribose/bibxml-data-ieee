    <abstract>This standard establishes specifications for high voltage (above 1000 volts) 1 distribution and power class expulsion, current-limiting and combination type external capacitor fuses and accessories, with rated voltages from 1 kV through 38 kV, for protecting shunt capacitors complying with IEEE 18 and NEMA CP 1. All of these devices are intended for use on alternating current systems. These fuses may be used with capacitor units, groups of units, or entire capacitor banks</abstract>
