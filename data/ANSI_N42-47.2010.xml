    <abstract>This standard applies to security screening systems that utilize x-ray or gamma radiation and are used to inspect people who are not inside vehicles, containers, or enclosures. Specifically, this standard applies to systems used to detect objects carried on or within the body of the individual being exposed. The purpose of this standard is to provide standard methods of measuring and reporting imaging quality characteristics and establish minimum acceptable performance requirements.</abstract>
