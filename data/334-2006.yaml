abstract:
- content: It is required that Class 1E motors, with their interfaces, meet or exceed
    the specified performance requirements throughout their service life. This is
    accomplished through a program that includes, but is not limited to, design, qualification,
    production quality control, shipping, storage, installation, operation, maintenance,
    periodic testing, and surveillance. This standard addresses the qualification
    portion of the program. It discusses the requirement for maintenance, repair,
    and surveillance of motors to maintain qualification of motors throughout their
    installed life but does not provide detailed guidance about how these programmatic
    items must be implemented and maintained. The qualification requirements of this
    standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability of the motor and/or insulation
    system to perform its safety function(s) under specified service conditions.

    installation, operation, maintenance, periodic testing, and surveillance. This
    standard addresses the qualification portion of the program. It discusses the
    requirement for maintenance, repair, and surveillance of motors to maintain qualification
    of motors throughout their installed life but does not provide detailed guidance
    about how these programmatic items must be implemented and maintained. The qualification
    requirements of this standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability
    of the motor and/or insulation system to perform its safety function(s) under
