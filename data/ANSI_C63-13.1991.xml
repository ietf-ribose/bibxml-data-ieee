    <abstract>A basic understanding of the application, evaluation, and safety considerations of electromagnetic interference (EMI) power-line filters used in both AC and DC applications is provided. The construction of an EMI power-line filter and its functions in providing suppression of conducted noise are described. The functions and performance of the filter components, particularly the capacitors and inductors, are discussed. It is explained why seemingly identical filters may not give the same performance in a particular application. No-load insertion-loss test methods are presented. Proper installation of the filters in equipment is discussed. Safety regulations are briefly addressed.</abstract>
