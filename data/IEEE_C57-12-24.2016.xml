    <abstract>Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered in this standard. It also takes into consideration certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz, liquid-immersed, self-cooled, submersible transformers with separable insulated high-voltage connectors. These transformers are rated 3750 kVA and smaller with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 V and below and with low voltages of 600 V and below.</abstract>
