  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This guide has been developed to provide a step-by-step process for selecting an appropriate termination that is commensurate with a particular shielded power cable design. Over the years, shielded power cables have been developed that employ many different insulating materials and many different shielding systems, such that, there are numerous issues to consider when selecting a termination for a particular cable design. Over the same period of time, many different termination methods and designs have been developed that serve the same purpose, but employ different application methodologies.</abstract>
