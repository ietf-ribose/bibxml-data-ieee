    <abstract>SUPERSEDED BY 1474.1-2004 Abstract: Performance and functional requirements for a communications-based train control (CBTC) system are established in this standard. A CBTC system is a continuous, automatic train control system utilizing high-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits; continuous, high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications; and trainborne and wayside processors capable of implementing automatic train protection (ATP) functions, as well as optional automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions. In addition to CBTC functional requirements, this standard also defines headway criteria, system safety criteria, and system availability criteria for a CBTC system.</abstract>
