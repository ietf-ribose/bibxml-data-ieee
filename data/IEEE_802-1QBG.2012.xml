    <abstract>This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011 specifies protocols, procedures, and managed objects that - Provide for the discovery, configuration, and control of a pair of direct-attached limited-function Service VLAN (S-VLAN) components to extend the services of a customer bridge to remote ports and enable coexistence of multiple services on station-resident ports (e.g., embedded bridging). - Provide for discovery, configuration, and control of a Reflective Relay Service for a bridge port. - Provide for discovery of, and coordinated configuration of, edge relays (ERs) and other devices that utilize the reflective relay service. - Provide for dynamic profile-driven port configuration.</abstract>
