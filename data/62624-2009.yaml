abstract:
  content: Adoption of IEEE Std 1650-2005. Recommended methods and standardized reporting
    practices for electrical characterization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are covered.
    Due to the nature of CNTs, significant measurement errors can be introduced if
    the electrical characterization design-of-experiment is not properly addressed.
    The most common sources of measurement error, particularly for highimpedance electrical
    measurements commonly required for CNTs, are described. Recommended practices
    in order to minimize and/or characterize the effect of measurement artifacts and
    other sources of error encountered while measuring CNTs are given.
