    <abstract>This standard defines a functional model for federation based on the NIST Cloud Federation Reference Architecture. This model allows a range of deployment topologies and governance. As a general federation model, it can be applied to many application domains using different implementation approaches. As such, it includes cloud-to-cloud federation and interoperability.</abstract>
