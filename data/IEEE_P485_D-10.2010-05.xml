    <abstract>Methods for defining the dc load and for sizing a lead-acid battery to supply that load for stationary battery applications in full-float operations are described. Some factors relating to cell selection are provided for consideration. Installation, maintenance, qualification, testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Design of the dc system and sizing of the battery charger(s) are also beyond the scope of this recommended practice.</abstract>
