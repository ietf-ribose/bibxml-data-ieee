    <abstract>ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748 provides unified and consolidated guidance on the life cycle management of systems and software. It draws on key aspects of the former IEEE J-Std-016 Standard for information technology software - Software life cycle processes - Software development - Acquirer-supplier agreement. The IEEE Standards Association has identified the need for a non-military standard to guide managers of software systems in software development planning.Taken together, the parts of ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748are intended to facilitate the joint usage of the process content of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, Systems and software engineering - System life cycle processes, which in turn may be used together with related standards such as for service management,and various lower-level process standards.</abstract>
