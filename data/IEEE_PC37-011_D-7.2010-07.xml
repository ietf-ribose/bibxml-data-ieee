    <abstract>Procedures and calculations necessary to apply the standard transient recovery voltage (TRV) ratings for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V and on a symmetrical current basis are covered. The capability limits of these circuit breakers are determined to a great degree by the TRV. TRV ratings are compared with typical system TRV duties.</abstract>
