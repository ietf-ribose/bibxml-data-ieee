    <abstract>ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207-2 provides the mapping expressing corresponding relations between software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and the processes in the previous edition ISO/IEC 12207:2008. These relations are demonstrated by means of mapping tables that show relationships between Process Outcomes, and Activities and Tasks in these both editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This mapping assists users of the ISO/IEC 12207:2008 edition to transition to using the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 edition. This document will help users understand the differences between the reference processes and requirements of the two editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and help the user to understand any potential gaps or process enhancements might be needed in seeking conformance to, and/or use of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Also, this document provides to such users the mapping which helps to identify corresponding and compatible process outcomes, activities and tasks of processes for software systems in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.</abstract>
