    <abstract>Ethernet local area network operation is specified for selected speeds of operation from 1 Mb/s to 10 Gb/s using a common media access control (MAC) specification, management information base (MIB), and capability for Link Aggregation of multiple physical links into a single logical link. The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol specifies shared medium (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation. Speed specific Media Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected physical layer (PHY) interfaces for operation over coxial, twisted pair or fiber optic cables. System considerations for multisegment shared access networks describe the use of Repeaters which are defined for operational speeds up to 1000 Mb/s. Local Area Network (LAN) operation is supported at all speeds. Other specified capabilities include: various PHY types for access networks, PHYs suitable for metropolitan area network applications, and the provision of power over selected twisted pair PHY types.
