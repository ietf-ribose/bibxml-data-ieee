    <abstract>The interfaces and data structures required to exchange sensing-related information in order to increase interoperability between sensors and their clients developed by different manufacturers are defined in this standard. The logical interface and supporting data structures are defined abstractly without constraining the sensing technology, client design, or data link between sensor and client. The entities involved and parameters exchanged in this process. It further elaborates on the service access points, service primitives, as well as generic procedures used to realize this information exchange, are defined by this standard.</abstract>
