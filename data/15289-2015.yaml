abstract:
  content: The purpose and content of all identified systems and software life cycle
    and service management information items (documentation) are specified in this
    standard. The information item contents are defined according to generic document
    types, as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose of the document (Clause
    10). This International Standard provides a mapping of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC
    12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013),
    and ISO/IEC 20000-2 (IEEE Std 20000-2:2013) clauses with a set of information
    items. This International Standard identifies records and information items based
    on analysis of references in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std
    12207-2008), ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013) and ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012
    (IEEE 20000-2:2013), which in some cases provide partial or complete outlines
    for the content of specific documents. However, the requirements for the life-cycle
    processes do not uniquely and unambiguously state the requirements for the information
    items contents or the information needed by a user of an information item. Moreover,
    the information from the life-cycle processes may overlap or may be created and
    revised at different times. In short, the analyzed references do not result in
    a logically complete list of information items.
