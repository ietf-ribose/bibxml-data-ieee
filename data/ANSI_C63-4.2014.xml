    <abstract>U.S. consensus standard methods, instrumentation, and facilities for measurement of radio-frequency (RF) signals and noise emitted from electrical and electronic devices in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz are specified. This standard does not include generic or product-specific emission limits. Where possible, the specifications herein are harmonized with other national and international standards used for similar purposes.</abstract>
