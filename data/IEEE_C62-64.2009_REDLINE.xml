    <abstract>Surge protectors for application on multiconductor and coaxial, balanced or unbalanced, data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V rms or 1200 V dc are covered. These surge protectors are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of one or more nonlinear elements and zero or more linear elements. The tables of typical performance values provide a means of comparison among various surge protectors. They also provide a common engineering language beneficial to the user and manufacturer of surge protectors used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits.</abstract>
