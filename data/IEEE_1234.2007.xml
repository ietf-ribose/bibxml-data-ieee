    <abstract>Tests and measurements that are performed on shielded power cables to identify the location of a fault are described. Whenever possible, the limitations of a particular test and measurement to locate a fault are provided and recommendations are made regarding specialized fault-locating techniques. A fault characterization chart is included as an aid to select a fault-locating technique.</abstract>
