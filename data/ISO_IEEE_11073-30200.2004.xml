    <abstract>This standard replaces IEEE Std 1073.3.2-2000. A connection-oriented transport profile and physical layer suitable for medical device communications in legacy devices is established. Communications services and protocols consistent with specifications of the Infrared Data Association are defined. These communication services and protocols are optimized for use in patient-connected badside medical devices.</abstract>
