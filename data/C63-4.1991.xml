    <abstract>ANSI C63.4-1991, American National Standard Methods of Measurement of Radio-Noise Emissions From Low-Voltage Electrical and Electronic Equipment in the Range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz, sets forth uniform methods of measurement of radio noise emitted from low-voltage electrical and electronic equipment, including digital and other information technology equipment (ITE), in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz. Methods for the measurement of radiated and power-line-conducted radio noise are covered and may be applied to any such equipment unless otherwise specified by individual equipment requirements.</abstract>
