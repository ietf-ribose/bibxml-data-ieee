abstract:
  content: Directions and requirements are provided for the conversion of qualified
    power switchgear equipment. Examples such as low-voltage power circuit breakers;
    high-voltage outdoor, and medium-voltage indoor drawout power circuit breakers;
    medium-voltage fused contactors; medium-voltage ground and test devices; medium-voltage
    fused load interrupter switches; and metal-enclosed switchgear are covered in
    this standard. Existing design standards are referenced with appropriate guidance
    on design testing necessary to design-verify the conversions. Reconditioning,
    which concerns the maintenance of existing equipment without alteration, is not
    covered.
