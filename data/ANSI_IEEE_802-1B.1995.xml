    <abstract>Services and protocol elements that permit the exchange of management information between stations attached to ISO/IEC standard local and metropolitan area networks are defined. The standard includes the specification of managed objects that permit the operation of the protocol elements to be remotely managed. In addition, an architecture for station discovery and the dynamic control of event forwarding is defined. Services and protocols that support station discovery and the dynamic control of event forwarding are defined.</abstract>
