    <abstract>Careful consideration of the physical and electrical characteristics of overhead lines and transmission cables are necessary in designing a transition structure between the two systems. Environmental and social factors also play a role in designing a transition. By considering the factors contained in this guide, the user will be better able to design a suitable transition that balances cost, operability, environmental factors, and future flexibility.</abstract>
