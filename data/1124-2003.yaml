abstract:
  content: Guidelines are provided for evaluating and mitigating harmonic induction
    effects from high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines on the adjacent telephone
    communication lines. Specifically, this guide presents methodology and approach
    for a) Determining the number of wireline communication circuits that will be
    affected by unacceptable interference and cost-effective remedial measures; and
    b) Computing interference levels that would result with various practical dc filter/smoothing
    reactor designs and the costs of these filters.
