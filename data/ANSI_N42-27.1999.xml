    <abstract>Minimum informational requirements for a Test and Measurement Report for flood sourc-es used with scintillation cameras are provided. It is not intended to specify the means by which such information is obtained although it does place requirements and limitations on the methodol-ogy. In addition, it is not intended to cover the use of the source in the determination of the operating characteristics or correction factors for a scintillation camera.</abstract>
