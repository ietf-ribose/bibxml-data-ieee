    <abstract>Enhancements to the IEEE 802.15.4(TM) smart utility network (SUN) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) physical layers (PHYs) that enable support for data rates up to 2.4 Mb/s are defined by this amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.4(TM)-2015. This amendment also defines additional channel plans, as needed, to support emerging applications.</abstract>
