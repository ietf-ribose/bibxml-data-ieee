    <abstract>Symbols to inform people about the presence of potentially hazardous levels of radiofrequency energy or the presence of contact current hazards in the frequency range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz are specified in this standard. Guidance is given about how these symbols should be used on warning signs and labels. (The PDF of this standards is available at no cost.
