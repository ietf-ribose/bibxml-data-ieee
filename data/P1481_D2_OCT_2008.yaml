abstract:
  content: Ways for integrated circuit designers to analyze chip timing and power
    consistently across a broad set of electric design automation (EDA) applications
    are covered in this standard. Methods by which integrated circuit vendors can
    express timing and power information once per given technology are also covered.
    In addition, this standard covers means by which EDA vendors can meet their application
    performance and capacity needs.
