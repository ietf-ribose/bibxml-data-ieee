    <abstract>The interfaces between and among functional systems on rail rapid transit vehicles is prescribed. The systems themselves are treated as "black boxes;" requirements for the input signals and the output response are given. For each category of interface, three types are listed in in-creasing technical sophistication.</abstract>
