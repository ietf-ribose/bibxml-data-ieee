    <abstract>In this guide is the application of Damped AC (DAC) for field testing 1 of power cables isdescribed. DAC voltage withstand testing and diagnostic tests and measurements that areperformed in combination with DAC voltage application in the field on shielded power cablesystems are discussed. Whenever possible, cable systems are treated in a similar manner toindividual cables. Tables and figures are included to show the effectiveness of the DAC acvoltage test, the diagnostic evaluation and the user experiences in the past years for field testing of different medium and (extra) high voltage cable system.</abstract>
