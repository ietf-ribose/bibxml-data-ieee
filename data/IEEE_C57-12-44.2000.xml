    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE Std C57.12.44-2005 The performance, electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and the safety of the equipment are covered. The proper selection of such equipment is established as a basis for use in this standard. Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are described; and certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz, low-voltage (600 V and below) network protectors are taken into consideration. This equipment is used for automatically connecting and disconnecting a network transformer from a secondary spot or grid network.</abstract>
