abstract:
  content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered
    in this standard. It also takes into consideration certain safety features of
    three-phase, 60 Hz, liquid-immersed, self-cooled, submersible transformers with
    separable insulated high-voltage connectors. These transformers are rated 3750
    kVA and smaller with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 V and below and with
    low voltages of 600 V and below.
