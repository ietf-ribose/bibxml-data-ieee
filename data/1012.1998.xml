    <abstract>Software verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes, which determine whether development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity, and whether the software satisfies its intended use and user needs, are described. This determination may include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing of software products and processes. V&amp;V processes assess the software in the context of the system, including the operational environment, hardware, interfacing software, operators, and users.</abstract>
