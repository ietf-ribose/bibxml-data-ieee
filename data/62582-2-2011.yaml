abstract:
- content: This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 contains methods for condition monitoring of
    organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using the
    indenter modulus technique in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible
    measurements. It includes the requirements for the selection of samples, the measurement
    system and measurement conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results.
    The different parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 are measurement standards, primarily for
    use in the management of ageing in initial qualification and after installation.
    Part 1 of IEC/IEEE 62582 includes requirements for the application of the other
    parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 and some elements which are common to all methods. Information
    on the role of condition monitoring in the qualification of equipment important
    to safety is found in IEEE Std 323. This standard is intended for application
    to nonenergised equipment.
