    <abstract>This standard applies to IE3 IP56, horizontal and vertical, single-speed, squirrel cage polyphase induction motors, up to and including 370 kW, for petroleum, chemical, and other severe-duty applications (commonly referred to as IE3 severe-duty motors). Excluded from the scope of this standard are motors with sleeve bearings and additional specific features required for Ex "d" motors.</abstract>
