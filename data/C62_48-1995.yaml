abstract:
  content: Information is provided to users and manufacturers of surge-protective
    devices(SPDs) about the interactions that may occur between SPDs and power system
    disturbances. This guide applies to SPDs manufactured to be connected to 50 or
    60 Hz ac power circuits rated at 100-1000 V rms. The effects and side effects
    of the presence and operation of SPDs on the quality of power available to the
    connected loads are described. The interaction between multiple SPDs on the same
    circuit is also described.
