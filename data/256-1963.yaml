abstract:
  content: 'This Standard recommends and describes methods of measurement of the important
    electrical characteristics of semiconductor diodes, For the purpose of this Standard,
    a semiconductor diode is defined as: "A semiconductor device having two terminals
    and exhibiting a nonlinear voltage-current characteristic ; in more restricted
    usage, a semiconductor device which has the asymmetrical voltage-current characteristic
    exemplified by a single p-n junction." Methods of test are described for static,
    small-signal and pulse parameters. Many of the terms considered herein have been
    set down in AIEE and IRE Standards, particularly in 60 IRE 28.S1 and AIEE No.
    425.'
