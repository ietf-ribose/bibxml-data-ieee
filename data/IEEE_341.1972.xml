    <abstract>This standard covers capacitance current switching requirements for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated in accordance with methods given in American National Standard Rating Structure for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.04-1964, and listed in American National Standard Schedules of Preferred Ratings and Related Required Capabilities for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.06-1972.2 It is anticipated that the manufacturers of circuit breakers will expend efforts to meet the requirements of these new standards as soon as possible. However, it is recognized that this will require time for completion; users are cautioned to confer with the manufacturer as to whether a specific design meets these standards. Circuit breakers manufactured before the publication date of this standard may not meet its requirements; the manufacturer should be consulted concerning the capacitance current switching capabilities of these earlier designs.</abstract>
