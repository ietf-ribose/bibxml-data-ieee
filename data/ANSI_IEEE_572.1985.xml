    <abstract>General requirements, direction, and methods for qualifying Class 1E connection assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations are provided. Connectors, terminations, and environmental seals in combination with related cables or wires as assemblies are covered. Emphasis is placed on multipin, quick, disconnect-type connection assemblies primarily utilized for instrumentation, control, and power. This standard does not apply to containment electric penetrations, fire stops, in-line splices, or components for service within the reactor vessel.</abstract>
