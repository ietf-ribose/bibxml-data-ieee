    <abstract>AI-ESTATE defines data interchange and for standard software services for test and diagnostic environments. The purpose of AI-ESTATE is to standardize interfaces for functional elements of an intelligent diagnostic reasoner and representations of diagnostic knowledge and data for use by such diagnostic reasoners. Formal information models are defined to form the basis for a format to facilitate exchange of persistent diagnostic information between two reasoners, and also to provide a formal typing system for diagnostic services. This standard also defines the services to control a diagnostic reasoner.</abstract>
