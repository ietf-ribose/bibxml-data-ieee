abstract:
  content: Superseded by IEEE 692-1997 Criteria are provided for the design of an
    integrated security system for nuclear power generating stations. Requirements
    are included for the overall system, interfaces, subsystems, and individual electrical
    and electronic equipment. This standard addresses equipment for securityrelated
    detection, surveillance, access control, communication, and data acquisition.
