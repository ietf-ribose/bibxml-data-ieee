    <abstract>This standard applies to semiconductor radiation detectors that are used for the detection and high-resolution spectroscopy of charged particles. The measurement techniques described were selected to be readily available to all manufacturers and users of charged-particle detectors. The object of this standard is to establish standard test procedures for semiconductor charged-particle detectors. These detectors are in widespread use for the detection and high-resolution spectroscopy of charged particles. It is desirable to maintain standard test procedures so that measurements may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
