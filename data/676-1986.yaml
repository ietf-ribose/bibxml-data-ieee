abstract:
  content: This guide provides guidelines for the organization of fossil-fueled power
    generating plant alarm and monitoring information into types and categories, taking
    into consideration information usefulness and limitations. This guide further
    serves to establish guidelines for correlating type and category of alarm and
    monitoring information with the appropriate information-display devices. Adherence
    to the categorization and the corresponding information-display techniques presents
    prioritized alarm and monitoring information to the operator which is appropriately
    proportioned between the window annunciator, CRT, mimic display, and printer.
    This also permits a reduction in the number of window annunciators over historic
    practices.<<ETX>>
