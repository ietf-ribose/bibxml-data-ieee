    <abstract>Grounding practices that have generally been accepted by the electric utility industry as contributing to effective grounding systems for personnel safety and equipment protection in generating stations are identified. A guide for the design of generating station grounding systems and for grounding practices applied to generating station indoor and outdoor structures and equipment, including the interconnection of the station and substation grounding systems, is provided.</abstract>
