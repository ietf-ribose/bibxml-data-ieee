    <abstract>This standard covers design, manufacturing, and testing unique to the application of uncontrolled semiconductor power rectifiers for dc supplied transportation substation applications up to 1500 Volts dc nominal output. The standard is intended to address traction power substation rectifiers that are to be provided as part of a rectifier transformer unit, or provided separately. This standard includes application information and extensive definitions of related technical terms.</abstract>
