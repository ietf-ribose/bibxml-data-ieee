    <abstract>This document describes near-field test practices for the measurement of antenna properties and recommends near-field measurement practices for the three principal geometries: cylindrical, planar, and spherical. It also recommends measurement practices for the calibration of probes used as reference antennas in near-field measurements.</abstract>
