abstract:
  content: Specifications that should be provided to characterize instrumentation
    used to measure the steady state root mean square (rms) value of magnetic and
    electric fields with sinusoidal frequency content in the range 10 Hz to 3 kHz
    are identified. The instrumentation, recommended calibration methods, and sources
    of measurement uncertainty are also described.
