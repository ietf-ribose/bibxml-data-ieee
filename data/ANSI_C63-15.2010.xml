    <abstract>This immunity measurement and measurement instrumentation specification document complements the recommended procedures for making emission measurements as specified in ANSI C63.4. The immunity methods are alternative methods that might be of use to manufacturers who want to ensure a reliable product and reduce customer complaints by adding some additional immunity into their products beyond that required by law or by correcting problems experienced in the field not related to regulatory requirements. This document generally covers the frequency range of 30 Hz to 10 GHz.</abstract>
