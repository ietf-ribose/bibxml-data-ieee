abstract:
  content: This recommended practice is a companion document for IEEE Std. 1597.1&trade;-2008.1
    It provides examples and problem sets to be used in the validation of computational
    electromagnetics (CEM) computer modeling and simulation techniques, codes, and
    models. It is applicable to a wide variety of electromagnetic (EM) applications
    including but not limited to the fields of antennas, signal integrity (SI), radar
    cross section (RCS), and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). This document shows
    how to validate a particular solution data set by comparing it to the data set
    obtained by measurements, alternate codes, canonical, or analytic methods.
