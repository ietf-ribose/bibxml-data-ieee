    <abstract>Guidance for synchronization, calibration, testing, and installation of phasor measurement units (PMUs) applied in power systems is provided. The following are addressed in this guide: (a) considerations for the installation of PMU devices based on application requirements and typical substation electrical bus configurations; (b) techniques focusing on the overall accuracy and availability of the time synchronization system; (c) test and calibration procedures for PMUs for laboratory and field applications; and (d) communications testing for connecting PMUs to other devices including phasor data concentrators.</abstract>
