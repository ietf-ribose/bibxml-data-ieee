    <abstract>Amended information for a high-speed Serial Bus that integrates well with most IEEE stan-dard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses is specified. This amendment is intended to extend the usefulness of a low-cost interconnect between external peripherals, as described in IEEE Std 1394-1995. This amendment to IEEE Std 1394-1995 follows the ISO/IEC 13213:1994 Command and Status Register (CSR) Architecture.</abstract>
