abstract:
- content: This standard provides multi-source and "plug and play" environment for
    the millions of metering devices in the field now and the future using the ANSI
    Type 2 optical port interface. It solves the problems associated with single source
    systems and with multi-source systems based upon proprietary communications protocols.
    Electric, water, and gas utilities and corresponding vendors can realize cost
    savings which ultimately shall benefit the client consumers of the utilities.
