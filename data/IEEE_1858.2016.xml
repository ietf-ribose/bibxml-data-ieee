    <abstract>Quantifying the performance of camera-equipped mobile devices is covered in this standard, with an emphasis on metrics and procedures appropriate to the types of sensors, lenses, and signal processing routines present on such devices. It is not intended as a general image quality standard for photographs produced by high-end dedicated cameras, e.g., DSLRs. Metrics include spatial frequency response, color uniformity, chroma level, lateral chromatic displacement, local geometric distortion, texture blur, and visual noise.</abstract>
