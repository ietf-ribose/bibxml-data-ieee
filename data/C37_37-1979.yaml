abstract:
  content: Superseded The concepts of allowable continuous current, allowable continuous
    current class, and loadability factors are used to establish the criteria for
    designating the load-current carrying capabilities of air switches over a range
    of ambient temperatures. This is accomplished through a family of loadability
    factor curves. The loadability factors are also presented in tabular form.
