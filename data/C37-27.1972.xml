    <abstract>This guide applies to low-voltage power circuit breakers of the 600-volt insulation class with separately mounted current-limiting Class J and Class L fuses for use on ac circuits with available short-circuit currents of 200 000 amperes (rms symmetrical) or less. Low-voltage integrally fused power circuit breakers (see American National Standard Low-Voltage AC Integrally Fused Power Circuit Breakers, C37.28-1969) and combinations of fuses and molded-case circuit breakers are not covered by this guide.</abstract>
