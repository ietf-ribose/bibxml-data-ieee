    <abstract>Provided in this guide are information and recommendations on the equipment, cable specimens, test conditions, test control methodologies, measurements, data analysis, and interpretation in performing accelerated aging tests for 5 kV to 46 kV rated cables using water-filled tanks. The accelerated aging tests may be time-to-failure tests and/or tests in which the samples are aged for fixed times followed by diagnostic testing.</abstract>
