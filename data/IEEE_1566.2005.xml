    <abstract>This standard applies to AC adjustable speed drive (ASD) systems rated over 375 kW and above 750 V output voltage as used in petrochemical and similar applications. It covers the performance requirements for an ASD system including, but not limited to, input transformer or reactor as required, power electronics, control interfaces, cooling system, switchgear, and motor. Requirements for power quality, engineering analysis, start-up assistance, training, and spare parts are also included. Certain items such as the motor, switchgear or transformer may be excluded from the scope of vendor supply if so specified in the data sheets; however the system vendor shall specify any special requirements for the equipment thus excluded.</abstract>
