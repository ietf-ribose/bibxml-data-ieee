    <abstract>The standard applies to wires and cables, used principally for power system communications and control purposes, which are located within electric supply locations or are installed within the zone of influence (ZOI) of the supply location ground potential rise (GPR), or which may be buried adjacent to electric power transmission and distribution lines. The standard covers the appropriate design requirements, electrical and mechanical parameters, the testing requirements, and the handling procedures for cables that are to be installed and operated in high voltage environments where they may be subjected to high voltages either by conduction, or inductive coupling, or both. Coaxial and fiber optic cables are specifically excluded from this standard except for those used in Ethernet applications. The objective of this standard is to provide information to assist in determining the electrical13 parameters of communication and control cables necessary to improve the overall reliability of these cables when used in high voltage environments. There should be a very high probability (greater than 99%) that these cables will perform their intended function for specified periods of time in high voltage interference conditions. The end result being more reliable communications over said cables. The information presented in this Standard will apply equally to either new or existing [already installed] cables.</abstract>
