    <abstract>This document covers methods, techniques, and designs to mitigate bird-related power interruptions and equipment damage resulting from avian interactions with electric facilities. This document addresses electrocutions, collisions, nesting problems, and outages caused by fecal contamination and fecal streamers. The topics include bird impacts to transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations. Woodpecker issues are also addressed. It is believed that resolving these issues will improve system reliability and minimize revenue losses.</abstract>
