    <abstract>This standard applies to surge protectors for application on multiconductor and coaxial, balanced or unbalanced, data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V rms, or 1200 V dc. These surge protectors are intended to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both. The surge protectors covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear elements, packaged for the purpose of limiting voltage, current, or both.</abstract>
