    <abstract>Procedures are given for testing amplifier and preamplifier systems with linear pulse-shaping networks for use with semiconductor, scintillation, and proportional detectors in the spectroscopy of ionizing radiation. The object is to provide a common language and methodology for users and manufacturers of pulse-amplifier systems. The emphasis in the methods of measurement is to enhance sensitivity and improve accuracy by working around the limitations of the test instruments, particularly oscilloscopes that have only a visual display for readout. A technique is used where possible, thereby reducing basic errors to the inaccuracy of precision resistors.</abstract>
