abstract:
  content: Terms, test methods, test circuits, measurement 1 procedures and preferred
    result values for the surge mitigation parameters of isolating transformers used
    in networking devices and equipment is set in this standard. Three types of isolating
    transformer are considered; mains low frequency power, high frequency power (switching
    mode power supplies) and signal (e.g.Ethernet data).
