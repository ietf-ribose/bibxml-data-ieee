    <abstract>This standard provides methods for determining antenna factors of antennas used for radiated emission measurements of electromagnetic interference (EMI) from 30 MHz to 1000 MHz. Antennas included are linearly polarized antennas such as tuned dipoles, biconical dipoles, log-periodic arrays, etc, which are used in measurements governed by ANSI C63.4-1988. The methods include standard site, reference antennas, standard antenna, and standard field methods. The latter two methods are incorporated by reference.</abstract>
