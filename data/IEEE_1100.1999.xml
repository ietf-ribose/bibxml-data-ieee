    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE Std 1100-2005 Abstract: Recommended design, installation, and maintenance practices for electrical powerand grounding (including both power- related and signal-related noise control) of sensitive elec-tronic processing equipment used in commercial and industrial applications are presented. Themain objective is to provide a consensus of recommended practices in an area where conflict-ing information and confusion, stemming primarily from different viewpoints of the sameproblem, have dominated. Practices herein address electronic equipment performance issueswhile maintaining a safe installation. A brief description is given of the nature of power qualityproblems, possible solutions, and the resources available for assistance in dealing with prob-lems. Fundamental concepts are reviewed. Instrumentation and procedures for conducting asurvey of the power distribution system are described. Site surveys and site power analysesare considered. Case histories are given to illustrate typical problems.</abstract>
