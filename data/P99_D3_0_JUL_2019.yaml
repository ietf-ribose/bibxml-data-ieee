abstract:
  content: A general form for the preparation of test procedures is provided in this
    standard. Points to be considered by technical committees in the preparation of
    specific instructions for the thermal evaluation of insulation systems for electric
    equipment are suggested. The test procedures involve accelerated thermal aging
    of insulation systems and specify tests that the committees deem pertinent based
    on conditions of use. The objective of the procedures is to provide for the functional
    evaluation, by test, of insulation systems for electric equipment.
