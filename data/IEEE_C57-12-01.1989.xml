    <abstract>Electrical, mechanical, and safety requirements of ventilated, nonventilated, and sealed dry-type distribution and power transformers or autotransformers, single and polyphase, with a voltage of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding, are described. Information that can be used as a basis for the establishment of performance, interchangeability, and safety requirements of equipment described, and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment, is given.</abstract>
