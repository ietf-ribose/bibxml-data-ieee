    <abstract>A digital interface for connecting transducers to microprocessors is defined. A TEDS and its data formats are described. An electrical interface, read and write logic functions to access the TEDS and a wide variety of transducers are defined. This standard does not specify signal conditioning, signal conversion, or how the TEDS data is used in applications.</abstract>
