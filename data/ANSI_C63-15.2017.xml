    <abstract>This immunity testing and test instrumentation specifications recommended practice complements the procedures for making emission measurements as specified in ANSI C63.4 and in ANSI C63.10. These immunity test methods can be of use to manufacturers who want to maximize product reliability and reduce customer complaints by improving the immunity of their products, beyond that required by applicable regulations, or by correcting problems experienced in deployment that are not related to regulatory requirements. This recommended practice generally covers the frequency range 30 Hz to 10 GHz.</abstract>
