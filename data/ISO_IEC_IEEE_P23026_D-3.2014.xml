    <abstract>This standard defines system engineering and management requirements for the life cycle of websites, including strategy, design, engineering, testing and validation, and management and sustainment for Intranet and Extranet environments. The goal of this standard is to improve the usability of informational websites and ease of maintenance of managed Web operations in terms of locating relevant and timely information, applying information security management, facilitating ease of use, and providing for consistent and efficient development and maintenance practices. .It applies to those using web technology to present information and communications technology (ICT) information, such as user documentation for systems and software, life-cycle documentation for systems and software engineering projects, and documentation of policies, plans, and procedures for IT service management. This standard provides requirements for website owners and website providers, managers responsible for establishing guidelines for website development and operations, for software developers and operations and maintenance staff who may be external or internal to the website owner's organization. It applies to websites for public access and for limited access, such as for users, customers, and subscribers seeking information on IT products and services. It includes increased emphasis on the human factors concerns for making information easily retrievable and usable for the intended audience. It focuses on vendor- and product-independent considerations.</abstract>
