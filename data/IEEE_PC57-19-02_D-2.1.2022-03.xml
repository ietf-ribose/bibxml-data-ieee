    <abstract>This standard covers electrical, mechanical, dimensional, and1 related requirements for non condenser bushings used in liquid immersed distribution transformers covered by IEEE Standards C57.12.20, C57.12.34, C57.12.36, and C57.12.38 and that have basic impulse insulation levels (BILs) of less than or equal to 200 kV. These requirements are to be interpreted, measured, or tested in accordance with IEEE Standards C57.19.00 unless otherwise stated in this standard</abstract>
