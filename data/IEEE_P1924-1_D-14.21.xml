    <abstract>A set of guidelines for the development of energy efficient and power-proportional digital architectures so that energy is only consumed when computations are underway and energy is reduced in the non-operating state is presented in this recommended practice. The purpose of this practice is to provide guidelines for the designers and developers of digital architectures for creating power-proportionality at different levels of the system.</abstract>
