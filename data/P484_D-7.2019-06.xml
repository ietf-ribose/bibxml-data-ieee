    <abstract>Recommended design practices and procedures for storage, location, mounting, ventilation, instrumentation, preassembly, assembly, and charging of vented lead-acid batteries are provided. Required safety practices are also included. These recommended practices are applicable to all stationary applications. Specific applications, such as emergency lighting units, semiportable equipment, and alternate energy applications, may have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended practice.</abstract>
