abstract:
- content: A standard procedure for naming time sequence data (TSD) files, such as
    files produced by digital fault recorders, power swing recorders, power quality
    monitors, and so on, is specified. The sources of TSD files are described, and
    a survey of current naming techniques is provided. The advantages of using a common
    naming procedure are highlighted, and the limitations and applications are identified.
    Issues of compatibility across operating systems and various vintages, and adaptability
    to other types of files, are also discussed. The required and optional portions
    of the naming procedure are described in detail, and many examples are provided.
