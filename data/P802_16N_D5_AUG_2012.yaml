abstract:
  content: Amendment to IEEE 802.16. This amendment specifies protocol enhancements
    to the medium access control layer (MAC) for enabling increased robustness and
    alternate radio path establishment in degraded network conditions. Limited orthogonal
    frequency-division multiple access physical layer (OFDMA PHY) extensions are included
    for enabling operation with radio path redundancy and direct communication between
    subscriber stations. Also mobile base stations and mobile relay stations are supported.
