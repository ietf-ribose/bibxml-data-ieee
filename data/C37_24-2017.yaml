abstract:
- content: Information to assist in evaluating the effect of solar radiation on outdoor
    metal-enclosed switchgear including metal-enclosed bus and control switchboards
    is provided in this guide. Specific data in the form of a continuous current capability
    factor for specific maximum monthly normal temperatures at the installation location
    to adjust the continuous current capability of outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear
    to the solar radiation condition required are given in this guide. Examples of
    maximum monthly normal temperatures along with sources for data for the US and
    for Canada are also presented in this guide.
