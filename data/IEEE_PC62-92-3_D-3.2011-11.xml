    <abstract>Basic factors and general considerations in selecting the class and means of neutral grounding for electrical generating plant auxiliary power systems are given in this guide. Apparatus to be used to achieve the desired grounding are suggested, and methods to specify the grounding devices are given. Sensitivity and selectivity of equipment ground-fault protection as affected by selection of the neutral grounding device are discussed, with examples.</abstract>
