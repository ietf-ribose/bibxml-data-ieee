    <abstract>Direction for the design and installation of safety-related electrical cable systems, including associated circuits, in nuclear power generating stations is provided. Existing standards are identified and guidance is provided for the design and installation of those non-safety-related cable systems that may affect the function of safety-related systems. Solutions are recommended for areas of concern such as fire protection, raceways, separation, cable performance requirements, and installation acceptance testing and documentation.</abstract>
