    <abstract>Original scope: The IEEE 1076 language has been primarily designed for the description and the simulation of digital hardware systems. As such, it provides only limited capabilities when used in analog modeling. VHDL 1076.1 aims to enhance VHDL 1076 such that it can support the description and simulation of circuits and systems that exhibit continuous behavior over time and over amplitude. The revision will correct editorial errors and clarify aspects of the language definition in the original document, and will update the document to reflect changes in the VHDL 1076 specification.</abstract>
