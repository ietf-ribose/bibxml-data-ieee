  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This American National Standard is a revision and expansion of USA Standard Graphic Symbols forElectrical and Electronics Diagrams, Y32.2-1967.A large number of new symbols has been added. While the major additions are in the areas ofantennas, transmission path, thermal relays, VHF/UHF/SHF circuit devices, and semiconductor devices, all sections have some new or revised items. New sections have been added to cover graphic symbols for special-purpose maintenance diagrams, analog computer symbols (formerly in IEEE Standard166), also equipment and station symbols for system diagrams, maps and charts. For convenienceof users, the class letters used to form reference designations (formerly in ANSI Y32.16) have nowbeen included in a new section of Y32.2. In this revision the symbols are slightly larger than in Y32.2-1967 edition, resulting in improved readability. A revised edition of the large symbol chart included with the Y32.2-1967 edition will be available separately to complement the new edition.All of the symbols are designed so that their connection points fall on a modular grid. This shouldhelp those who use a grid basis for the preparation of diagrams. By proper enlargement of the symbolthe usual coordinate-grid sizes can be matched.</abstract>
