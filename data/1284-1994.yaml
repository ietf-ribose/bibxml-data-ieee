abstract:
  content: A signaling method for asynchronous, fully interlocked, bidirectional parallel
    communications between hosts and printers or other peripherals is defined. A format
    for a peripheral identification string and a method of returning this string to
    the host outside of the bidirectional data stream is also specified<<ETX>>
