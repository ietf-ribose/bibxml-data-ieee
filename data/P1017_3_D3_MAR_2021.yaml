abstract:
  content: Minimum requirements for the design, construction, manufacturing, testing,
    purchasing, and application of electric submersible pump cable are presented.
    The cable is round or flat, with polypropylene insulation, nitrile or polypropylene
    jacket, or metallic barrier or armor. These cables are for voltages not exceeding
    8 kV (phase to phase) and conductor temperatures not exceeding 96 ºC (205 ºF)
    maximum or &#8211;10 ºC (14 ºF) minimum. Conductors, insulation, barrier(optional),
    assembly with or without jacket, and armor or encapsulating material, requirements
    for testing by the manufacturer, and cable ampacity are all covered in the document.
