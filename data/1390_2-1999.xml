    <abstract>The telephone network interface to a telemetry interface unit operating under the utility telemetry service architecture is described. The interface is described in terms of a utility meter reading application, but any enhanced service provider communication can be transported. Telemetry calls may be initiated by either the utility/enhanced service provider (outbound) or the telemetry interface unit/customer premise equipment (inbound) on the end user's premise.</abstract>
