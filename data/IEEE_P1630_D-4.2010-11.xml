    <abstract>The purpose of this standard is to provide minimum design requirements for supporting structures types to provide support of overhead contact systems for electrified transit. This standard is developed to govern the design and fabrication of supporting structures for OCS. It is provided to define minimum general design and construction parameters for the following tubular steel pole types: tapered and constant diameter round, tapered and constant diameter multi-sided, sectionaland fluted.</abstract>
