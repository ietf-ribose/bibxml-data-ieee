    <abstract>Software verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes, which determine whether development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity, and whether the software satisfies its intended use and user needs, are described. This determination may includeanalysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing of software products andprocesses.
