    <abstract>Single-phase instrument transformers of a nominal system voltage of 115 kV and above with capacitive insulation system for line-to-ground connection and for both indoor and outdoor application are discussed in this standard. This standard is intended for use as a supplement to IEEE Std C57.13-2016 and as a basis for performance and safety of equipment. Test sequences, criteria, methods, and documentation for the test are also described.</abstract>
