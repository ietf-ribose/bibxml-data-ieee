abstract:
  content: A guide to the application of composite insulators to overhead transmission
    and distribution lines is provided. It is based on utility field experience, results
    of research aboratory tests, and manufacturers recommendations. The guide deals
    with composite insulators, which include a core, weathersheds, and metal end fittings.
    The core consists of resin and axially-aligned glass fibres. The weathersheds
    are of polymeric materials.
