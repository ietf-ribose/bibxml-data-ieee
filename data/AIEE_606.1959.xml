    <abstract>The Recommended Specifications consist of four sections. Specification Sections II, III and IV are complete purchase specifications. They cover alternate arrangements and performance requirements of speed-governing systems for internal combustion engine-generator units. These are printed as individual forms. To gain the maximum benefit from these standards, particularly under normal conditions, it is recommended that the applicable section be included in full and as a part of the complete purchase specifications for the particular engine-generator unit. The Terminology, Section I, includes definitions and applications of terms and some explanatory comments. Pertinent portions of Section I, while not ordinarily transcribed in full, are made an integral part of each speed-governing specification as indicated in paragraphs 2 of Specification Sections II, III, and IV.</abstract>
