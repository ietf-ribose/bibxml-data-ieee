    <abstract>This project will define a 25 to 100 GHz (millimeter wave) alternative PHY clause for higher data rate amendment to Standard 802.15.3-2003. This frequency range allows for the USA and Japanese unlicensed allocations and expected unlicensed allocations in other countries. Data rates will be at least 1 Gbps under normal operating conditions with a typical range no less than 10 meters.</abstract>
