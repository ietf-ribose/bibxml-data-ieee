abstract:
- content: Experience and continuing rapid development in electrical insulation have
    demonstrated the need for periodic review and revision of this document. During
    the time since the 1962 revision of this document, there has been a need for a
    more distinct separation of insulation systems and insulating materials. Confusion
    in nomenclature be tween insulating materials and insulation systems has continued
    to exist. This present document attempt to overcome this conflict through the
    complete separation of insulating materials from insulation systems and by the
    introduction of the temperature index concept for insulating materials. To clarify
    this separation a distinct section, Part IV, is now provided for insulating materials.
