    <abstract>Conformance tests and requirements for the integrity of above-grade pad-mounted enclosures for application in coastal environments that contain apparatus energized in excess of 600 V and that may be exposed to the public are described. These include, but are not limited to,the following types of equipment enclosures: pad-mounted capacitors or inductors, pad-mounted distribution transformers, pad-mounted junction enclosures, pad-mounted metering equipment, pad-mounted switchgear, and pad-mounted voltage regulators.</abstract>
