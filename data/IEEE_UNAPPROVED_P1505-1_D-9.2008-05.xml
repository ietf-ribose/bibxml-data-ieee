    <abstract>This trial-use standard, IEEE 1505.1 The Common Test Interface Pin Map Configuration for High-Density, Single-Tier Electronics Test Requirements Utilizing IEEE Std 1505 represents an extension to the IEEE-1505 Receiver Fixture Interface (RFI) Standard Specification. Particular emphasis is placed on defining within the IEEE-1505 RFI Standard a more specific set of performance requirements that employ a common scalable (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific connector modules; (c) respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation; and (e) legacy ATE transitional devices. This is intentionally done to standardize the footprint and assure mechanical and electrical interoperability between past and future Automatic Test Systems (ATS).</abstract>
