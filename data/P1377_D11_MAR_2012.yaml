abstract:
  content: Common structures are provided in this standard for encoding data in communication
    between End Devices (meters, home appliances, IEEE 1703 Nodes) and Utility enterprise
    collection and control systems using binary codes and Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) content. The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and SmartGrid requirements
    are addressed as identified by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability
    of the U.S. Department of Energy and by the Smart Metering Initiative of the Ontario
    Ministry of Energy (Canada) and of Measurement Canada. Sets of tables are exposed
    that are grouped together into sections that pertain to a particular feature-set
    and related function such as Time-of-use, Load Profile, Security, Power Quality,
    and more. Each standard Table Set (Data Model) can be expanded or restricted by
    the Manufacturer of the IEEE 1377 Device or home appliance using XML/TDL descriptive
    registered syntax (XML-based Table Definition Language) and enterprise data-value
    management using EDL (Exchange Data Language) in a manner that is machine readable.
    Published jointly with NEMA and Measurement Canada, Tables are provided in support
    of Gas, Water, and Electric sensors and related appliances. Tables are also provided
    for network configuration and management by referencing its companion standard
    IEEE Std 1703TM-2012. IEEE Std 1377-2012 is co-published as ANSI C12.19 and MC12.19.
