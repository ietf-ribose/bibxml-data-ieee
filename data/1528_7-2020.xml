  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">In the wireless communication field, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are the main emerging technologies and future wireless communication will rely on them. A methodology for classifying IoT devices based on radio frequency (RF) exposure characteristics is provided. Classification is based on frequency, bandwidth, radiated power, and typical installation configuration. Links between device class and available measurement/computational standards are provided. A framework criterion for exclusion classes for exposure assessment and criteria for addressing situations where exposure assessment is unavailable are included.</abstract>
