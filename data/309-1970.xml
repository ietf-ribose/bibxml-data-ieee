    <abstract>This publication presents standard test procedures for Geiger-Muller counter radiation detectors. These detectors, originally announced by ?Geiger and Muller in 1928, represented a major step forward in the detection and counting of individual radioactive events. Standard test procedures are desirable so that measurements may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
