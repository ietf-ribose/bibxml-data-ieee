    <abstract>Describes the standardisation of measurement methods and procedures to enable the determination of a direction finder's (DF) characteristics which will permit analysis of DF performance in a uniform manner. Standard test conditions are given and test equipment is discussed. Direction finder sensitivity and system accuracy measurements are discussed, and time requirements and interference are considered.</abstract>
