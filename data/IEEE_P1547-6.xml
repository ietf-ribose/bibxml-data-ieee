    <abstract>This standard builds upon IEEE Std 1547 for the interconnection of distributed resources (DR) to distribution secondary network systems. This standard establishes recommended criteria, requirements and tests, and provides guidance for interconnection of distribution secondary network system types of area electric power systems (area EPS) with distributed resources (DR) providing electric power generation in local electric power systems (Local EPS).</abstract>
