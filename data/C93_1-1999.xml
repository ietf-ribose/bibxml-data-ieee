    <abstract>This standard applies to capacitors for coupling power-line carriers and for reducing rate of rise of breaker transient recovery voltage, and to coupling capacitor voltage transformers (CCVT) for connection to a high voltage power circuit, between line and ground, to supply a low voltage for measurement, control, and protective functions. A CCVT may or may not have provision for power-line carrier coupling. This standard does not include bushing potential devices, or secondary compensated-field adjustable CCVTs.</abstract>
