    <abstract>This guide is to serve as a reference document for practicing engineers in the hydroelectric industry. It documents prevailing industry practices in hydroelectric power plant control system logic, control system configurations, and control modes. It describes the control and monitoring requirements for equipment and systems associated with conventional and pumped-storage hydroelectric plants. It includes typical methods of local and remote control, details of the control interfaces for plant equipment, requirements for centralized and off-site control.</abstract>
