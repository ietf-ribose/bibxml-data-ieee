    <abstract>Specifications that should be provided to characterize instrumentation used to measure the steady state root mean square (rms) value of magnetic and electric fields with sinusoidal frequency content in the range 10 Hz to 3 kHz are identified. The instrumentation, recommended calibration methods, and sources of measurement uncertainty are also described.</abstract>
