    <abstract>Communication services to support information exchange between simulation applications participating in the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) environment are defined. These communication services describe a connectionless information transfer that supports real-time, as well as non-real-time, exchange. Several communication profiles specifying communication services are provided.</abstract>
