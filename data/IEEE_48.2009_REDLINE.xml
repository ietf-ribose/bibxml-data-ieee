    <abstract>This standard covers all indoor and outdoor cable terminations used on alternating-current shielded cables having laminated insulation from 2.5 kV through 765 kV and extruded insulation rated 2.5 kV through 500 kV, except separable insulated connectors, which are covered by IEEE Std 386. Cable terminations and component parts shall be capable of withstanding the tests specified in this standard.</abstract>
