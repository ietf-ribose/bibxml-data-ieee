    <abstract>This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations and Protective Relays. Direction is provided for the selection of monitoring and for diagnostic parameters to be used with high-voltage circuit breakers (i.e., above 100 V). Guidance on appropriate parameters to be considered for monitoring applied to various circuit breaker technologies is also provided.</abstract>
