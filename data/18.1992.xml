    <abstract>Superseded by 18-2002. Capacitors rated 216 V or higher, 2.5 kvar or more, and designed for shunt connection to alternating-current transmission and distribution systems operating at a nominal frequency of 50 or 60 Hz are considered. Service conditions, ratings, manufacturing, and testing are covered. A guide to application and operation of power capacitors is included.</abstract>
