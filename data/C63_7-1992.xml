    <abstract>Information that is useful in constructing an open-area test site (OATS) used to perform radiated emission measurements in the frequency range of 30-1000 MHz is provided. Final validity of the test site can only be made by performing site attenuation measurements as described in ANSI C63.4-2003.</abstract>
