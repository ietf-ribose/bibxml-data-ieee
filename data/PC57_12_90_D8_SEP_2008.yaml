abstract:
  content: Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00TM-2006 and
    other standards applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating
    transformers are described. Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction
    voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty
    transformers, grounding transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. This
    standard covers resistance measurements, polarity and phaserelation tests, ratio
    tests, no-load-loss and excitation current measurements, impedance and load loss
    measurements, dielectric tests, temperature tests, short-circuit tests, audible
    sound level measurements, and calculated data.
