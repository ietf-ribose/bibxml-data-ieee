    <abstract>Information and general recommendations of instrumentation, circuitry, calibration, and measurement techniques of no-load losses (excluding auxiliary losses), excitation current, and load losses of power and distribution transformers are provided. The guide is intended as a complement to the test code procedures given in Clause 8 and Clause 9 of IEEE Std C57.12.90TM.</abstract>
