    <abstract>This standard covers electrical characteristics and mechanical features of liquid-immersed transformers 69 kV or less (but not limited to 69 kV), used for supplying electric power to direct arc-melting furnaces. All characteristics and definitions, except as specifically covered in this standard, shall be in accordance with the IEEE Requirements for Liquid-Immersed Distribution, Power, and Regulating Transformers (C57.12 Series).</abstract>
