    <abstract>The electrical, dimensional, and related special requirements for high current rating power transformer bushings within bus enclosures that have rated continuous current in excess of 5000 A are addressed in this standard. Bushings covered by this standard are intended for use as components of liquid-filled transformers, including but not limited to Generator Step-Up (GSU) Transformers.</abstract>
