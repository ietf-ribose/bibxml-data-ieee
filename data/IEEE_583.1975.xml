    <abstract>This standard is intended to serve as a basis for a range of modular instrumentation capable of interfacing transducers and other devices to digital controllers for data and control. It consists of mechanical standards and signal standards that are sufficient to ensure physical and operational compatibility between units regardless of source.</abstract>
