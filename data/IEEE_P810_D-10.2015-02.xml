    <abstract>This standard does not include data on shaft stress limits, materials, or bolt tensioning For historical purposes, the legacy shaft dimensional requirements of superseded IEEE Standard 810-1987 are included in Annex A for use by hydroelectric plant owners, operators and designers involved in the disassembly and re-assembly of hydraulic turbines and generators. These legacy systems, primarily installed in North American facilities, generally employ US customary units of measurement.</abstract>
