    <abstract>Amendment #1 to IEEE Std 802.1D-2004 The scope of this project is limited to amending 802.1D-2004 to support Bridging of IEEE Std 802.17 MACs. This involves: Adding one subclause to clause 6 of 802.1D describing the service interface mapping between the Internal Sublayer Service and the 802.17 MAC service; Minor changes elsewhere in the document as needed to accommodate support of the additional MAC, including priority mapping in Clause 7 and the PICS Proforma in Annex A. Related Products: IEEE Std 802.17-2004, IEEE 802.1D-2004. The "IEEE Get Program" grants public access to view and download individual PDFs of select standards at no charge.
