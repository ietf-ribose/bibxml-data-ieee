    <abstract>Procedures for the measurement of electric and magnetic fields in close proximity to video display terminals (VDTs) in the frequency range of 5 Hz to 400 kHz are provided. Existing international measurement technologies and practices are adapted to achieve a consistent and harmonious VDT measurement standard for testing in a laboratory controlled environment.</abstract>
