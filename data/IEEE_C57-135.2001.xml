    <abstract>Theory, application of phase-shifting transformers, and the difference of specification and testing to standard system transformers are described. Various types of phase-shifting transformers and how to select the optimal design to achieve required control of power flow are covered. An understanding of the terminology, types, construction, and testing specifical to phase-shifting transformers is provided. Replaced by IEC 62032 Ed.1 (2005-03)</abstract>
