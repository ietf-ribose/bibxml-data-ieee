    <abstract>The application of metal-oxide surge arresters to safeguard electric power equipment against the hazards of abnormally high voltage surges of various origins is covered. Step-by step directions toward proper solutions of various applications are provided. In many cases, the prescribed steps are adequate. More complex and special solutions requiring study by experienced engineers are described, but specific solutions are not always given. The procedures are based on theoretical studies, test results, and experience.</abstract>
