    <abstract>The processes and procedures that should be followed by users of the High Level Architecture (HLA)to develop and execute federations are de .ned in this recommended practice.This recommended practice is not intended to replace low-level management and systems engineering practices native to HLA user organizations,but is rather intended as a higher-level framework into which such practices can be integrated and tailored for specific uses.</abstract>
