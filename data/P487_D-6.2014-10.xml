    <abstract>General considerations are presented for the electrical protection of telecommunication facilities serving electric supply locations. This document contains material which is common to the 487-family of Standards (i.e., dot-series) including fundamental protection theory, basic electrical protection philosophy, concepts and designs, protection apparatus; service types, reliability, service performance objective classifications, and transmission considerations. In general, special protective measures, handling procedures, and administrative procedures are necessary to provide electrical protection against damage to telecommunication facilities and equipment, maintain reliability of service and ensure the safety of personnel.</abstract>
