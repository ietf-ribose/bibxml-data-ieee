    <abstract>Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care (POC) medical device communication (MDC), the nomenclature defined by the base ISO/IEEE 11073-10101:2004 nomenclature standard is extended by this amendment. Significant extensions to support haemodynamics, respiration, ventilation and anesthesia monitoring, blood gas, urine, fluid-related metrics, and neurology, as well as units of measurements and measurement sites, are included. Formal definitions for observation identifiers used by the IEEE 11073 Personal Health Device standards and additional attributes for reporting their regulatory and certification status are also captured and provided. Information attributes to support alert communication and accurate medical device time synchronization and timekeeping are also defined.</abstract>
