abstract:
  content: 'This standard defines a structure of low altitude airspace for efficient
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) traffic management. The standard elaborates the
    structural low altitude based on UAV low altitude public air routes from five
    parts: grid technology, remote sensing data, communication and networking, route
    planning, operation and management. Gridding and coding techniques (Section 4.1)
    are the basic techniques for constructing structured low altitude; Remote sensing
    (Section 4.2) and surface object extraction technology are important sources of
    surface geographic information for low-altitude structural construction, which
    can meet the demand of high dynamic updating of information; Communication and
    networking technology (Section 4.3) can provide high-quality and reliable communication
    and data link for low-altitude UAV operations; The low altitude air route (Section
    4.4) is a kind of fine low altitude airspace structure; Operation and management
    techniques (Section 4.5) provide macro policy support for the docking between
    the route and UTM. In addition, three annexes (A/B/C) are attached to show the
    details of low-altitude structure. The method proposed above comprehensively utilizes
    interdisciplinary technologies such as RS, geographic information system (GIS),
    aviation and transportation for efficient UAV operations in low altitude. This
    standard was supported and funded by the National Key Research and Development
    Program of China (No. 2017YFB0503005), the National Natural Science Foundation
    of China (Nos. 41771388, 41971359), and the Strategic Priority Research Program
    of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA19050501).'
