    <abstract>IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015 defines the protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low-data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network (WPAN). A variety of physical layers (PHYs) have been defined that cover a wide variety of frequency bands.</abstract>
