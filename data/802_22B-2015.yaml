abstract:
- content: Alternate physical layer (PHY) and necessary medium access control layer
    (MAC) enhancements to IEEE Std 802.22-2011 are specified in this amendment for
    operation in very high frequency/ultra-high frequency (VHF/UHF) television broadcast
    bands between 54 MHz and 862 MHz to support enhanced broadband services and monitoring
    applications. The amendment supports aggregate data rates greater than the maximum
    data rate supported by the IEEE Std 802.22-2011. This amendment defines new classes
    of IEEE 802.22(TM) devices to address these applications and supports more than
    512 devices in a network. This amendment also specifies techniques to enhance
    communications among the devices and makes necessary amendments to the cognitive,
    security, and parameters and connection management clauses. This amendment supports
    mechanisms to enable coexistence with other IEEE 802(R) systems in the same band.
