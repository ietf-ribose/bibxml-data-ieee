    <abstract>An optional local medium access control (MAC) address space structure, known as the Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP), is provided in this amendment to IEEE Std 802®-2014 in order to allow multiple administrations to coexist. This structure designates a range of local MAC addresses for protocols using a Company ID (CID) assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority. Another range of local MAC addresses is designated for assignment by administrators. The amendment recommends a range of local MAC addresses for use by IEEE 802® protocols.(The PDF of this standard is available at no cost to you compliments of the IEEE GET program http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=8016707.</abstract>
