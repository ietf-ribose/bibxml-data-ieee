    <abstract>The various tests that are made on AC high-voltage circuit breakers are summarized. Accepted methods used in making the tests are described, and the tests that will demonstrate ratings under ANSI/IEEE standards are specified. The following categories of tests are considered: design tests, production tests, tests after delivery, field tests, and conformance tests.</abstract>
