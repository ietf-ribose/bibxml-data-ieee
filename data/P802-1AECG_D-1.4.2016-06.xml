    <abstract>This amendment specifies Ethernet Data Encryption Devices (EDEs). An EDE is a two port bridge that uses MACsec to provide secure connectivity for attached customer bridges, or for attached provider bridges. EDEs may allow the customer (or provider) bridges to continue to use a VLAN Identifier (VID) in transmitted frames to select (as already specified in 802.1Q) between provider network or provider backbone network services.</abstract>
