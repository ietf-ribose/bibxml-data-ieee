    <abstract>Criteria are provided for the design of an integrated security system for nuclear powergenerating stations. Requirements are included for the overall system, interfaces, subsystems, andindividual electrical and electronic equipment. This standard addresses equipment for security-relateddetection, surveillance, access control, communication, data acquisition, and threat assessment.</abstract>
