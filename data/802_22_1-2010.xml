  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This standard defines the protocol and data formats for communication devices forming a beaconing network that are used to protect low-power, licensed devices operating in television broadcast bands from harmful interference generated by license-exempt devices, such as Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN), intended to operate in the same bands. The devices being protected are devices licensed as secondary under Title 47, Part 74, Subpart H in the USA and equivalent devices in other regulatory domains.</abstract>
