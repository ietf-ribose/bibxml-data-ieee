abstract:
- content: Outdoor and indoor composite station post insulators used in high-voltage
    direct-current power transmission systems are covered in this standard. The composite
    station post insulators covered by this standard consist of a load-bearing insulating
    core (or tube), a housing (outside the insulating solid core or tube) made of
    elastomer material (e.g., silicone or ethylene-propylene), and end fittings attached
    to the insulating core (or tube).
