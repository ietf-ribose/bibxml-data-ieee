    <abstract>The selection and application of controllers and automation to industrial and commercial power systems is covered by this recommended practice. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience with this equipment. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.</abstract>
