    <abstract>IEEE¿s Industrial Applications Society has determined a need for reorganizing the IEEE¿s Color Books Series, 13 books that currently cover various topics that fall under the purview of the Industrial and Commercial Power Industry. This recommended practice covers the maintenance of industrial and commercial power systems. It covers the fundamentals of electrical equipment maintenance, how to develop successful maintenance strategies, and the common testing methods used as part of an electrical equipment maintenance program.</abstract>
