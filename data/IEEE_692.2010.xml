    <abstract>Criteria are provided for the design of an integrated security system for nuclear power generating stations. Requirements are included for the overall system, interfaces, subsystems, and individual electrical and electronic equipment. This standard addresses equipment for security-related detection, surveillance, access control, communication, data acquisition, and threat assessment.</abstract>
