- content: This guide provides the general recommendations for performing maintenance
    work on energized power lines. It is not intended to include all of the proven
    practical methods and procedures, however, these selected comprehensive recommendations
    are based on sound engineering principles, engineering safety considerations,
    and field experience by many utilities. Included are technical explanations as
    required to cover certain laboratory testing of tools and equipment, in-service
    inspection, maintenance and care of tools and equipment, and work methods of the
    maintenance of energized lines for persons working in vicinity of power lines.
