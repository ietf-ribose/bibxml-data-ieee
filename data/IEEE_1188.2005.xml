    <abstract>This recommended practice is limited to maintenance, test schedules and testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life and performance of valve regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries for stationary applications. It also provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. An amendment IEEE Std 1888a is available for this standard.</abstract>
