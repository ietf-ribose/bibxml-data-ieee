    <abstract>This standard covers the test requirements, including test sequences, criteria, methods, and documentation for instrument transformers of 115 kV nominal system and above. It is to be used a supplement to IEEE STD C57.13-1993. Besides the provision of up-to-date test requirements, the trial-use standard also provides test procedures that were not adequately covered in the previous standard.</abstract>
