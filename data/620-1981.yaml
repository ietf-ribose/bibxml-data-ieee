abstract:
  content: This guide defines thermal limit curves, recommends a standard procedure
    for construction of the curves, and provides the definitions and information necessary
    to properly use these curves. The guide also describes thermal limit curves for
    large squirrel-cage motors defined as those motor ratings built in frames larger
    than the frame normally used for 500 hp, 1800 r/min motors.
