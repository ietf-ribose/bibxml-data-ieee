    <abstract>This standard covers the requirements for three-phase unit substations for step-down operation in the range of 112.5 kVA through 10 000 kVA at primary voltages of 601 volts through 38 kilovolts. The standard is intended for use as the basis for the coordination of equipment by assisting in the selection of components. A variety of designs for unit substations are possible using various combinations of incoming sections, transformer sections, outgoing sections, and transition (throat) sections. Since the transformer section determines the kVA and voltage capabilities of a unit substation, the ratings of the various types of unit substations are described in terms of transformer capability.</abstract>
