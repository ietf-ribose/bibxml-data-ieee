    <abstract>Specifications that should be provided to characterize instrumentation used to measure the steady state RMS value of magnetic and electric fields with sinusoidal frequency content in the range 10 Hz to 3 kHz in residential and occupational settings as well as in transportation systems are identified. The instrumentation, recommended calibration methods, and sources of measurement uncertainty are also described.</abstract>
