    <abstract>This new dry-type transformer standard describes ventilated dry-type transformers with self-cooled kilovolt-ampere ratings 501 to 7500 and high voltages 601 to 34 500 volts; forced-air-cooled ratings for certain sizes are listed in Part II. (American National Standards Committee on Specialty Transformers, C89, has responsibility for transformers with high voltages 600 volts and below.) This standard is part of a new series of dry-type standards that also includes American National Standard General Requirements for Dry-Type Distribution and Power Transformers, ANSI/IEEE C57.12.01-1979; American National Standard Test Code for Dry-Type Distribution and Power Transformers, ANSI/ IEE C57.12.91-1979; American National Standard Requirements for Ventilated Dry-Type Distribution Transformers, 1 to 500 kVA, Single-Phase, and 15 to 500 kVA, Three-Phase, with High-Voltage 601 to 34 500 Volts, Low-Voltage 120 to 600 Volts, ANSI C57.12.50-1981; and American National Standard Requirements for Sealed Dry-Type Power Transformers, 501 kVA and Larger, Three-Phase, with High-Voltage 601 to 34 500 Volts, Low-Voltage 208Y/120 to 4160 Volts, ANSI C57.12.52-1981</abstract>
