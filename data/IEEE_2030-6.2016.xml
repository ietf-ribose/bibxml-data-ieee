    <abstract>A framework for monitoring the effects and evaluating comprehensive benefits of demand response programs is proposed in this guide. From perspectives of ex-ante and ex-post evaluation, this guide introduces the evaluation processes on demand response effects with its comprehensive benefits and implemented calculation methods in detail. This guide could be applied in various electricity market structures to provide utilities with the references for the planning, design, implementation, and post-evaluation of demand response programs.</abstract>
