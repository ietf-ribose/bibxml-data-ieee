    <abstract>This recommended practice defines many common parameters for ac-dc and dc-dc electronic power distribution components and subsystems. This enables electronic system engineers, manufacturers, and researchers to speak with a common language and hence facilitates effective and efficient communications. Furthermore, implementation of a common specification language will allow the power electronics industry as well as the user communities, including government system developers, to acquire cost and time-effective electronic power subsystems with significantly enhanced interchangeability.</abstract>
