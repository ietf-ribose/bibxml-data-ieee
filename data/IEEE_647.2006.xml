    <abstract>Specification and test requirements for a single-axis ring laser gyro (RLG) for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. A standard specification format guide for the preparation of a single-axis RLG is provided. A compilation of recommended procedures for testing an RLG, derived from those presently used in the industry, is also provided.</abstract>
