    <abstract>A major goal of this standard is to improve communication of bioinformatics protocols and data in order to facilitate bioinformatics workflow related exchange and communication between regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, bioinformatics platform providers and researchers. A detailed communication helps ensure responsibility, reproducibility, verify bioinformatics protocol, track provenance information and promote interoperability. In addition, this standard also defines the assurance program for evaluating and certifying products against those requirements.</abstract>
