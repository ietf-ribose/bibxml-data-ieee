    <abstract>Data messages, known as Protocol Data Units (PDUs), that are exchanged on a network amongsimulation applications are defined. These PDUs are for interactions that take place within specifieddomains called protocol families, which include Entity Information/Interaction, Warfare, Logistics, SimulationManagement, Distributed Emission Regeneration, Radio Communications, Entity Management, Minefield,Synthetic Environment, Simulation Management with Reliability, Information Operations, Live EntityInformation/Interaction, and Non-Real-Time protocol.</abstract>
