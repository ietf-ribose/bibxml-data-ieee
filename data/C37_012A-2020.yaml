abstract:
- content: Covered in this amendment are changes in di/dt limitations for non-oil
    circuit breakers. A section has been added describing possible delayed current
    zeros when doing a rapid close-open of a line circuit breaker (CO) when shunt
    reactors are connected to a line or cable. Some minor errors have been corrected
    and references have been updated.
