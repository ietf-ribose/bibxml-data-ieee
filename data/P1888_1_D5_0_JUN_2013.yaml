abstract:
  content: This standard describes the network gateway access, control and management,
    specifies control and management requirements, defines the system architecture,
    communication sequences and enhanced functions for the protocols defined in IEEE
    1888 "Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network Protocol", and extends the protocols
    and interfaces based on the requirements. This standard shall provide enhanced
    protocols, workflows and message format for the network gateway under control
    and management such as registration, access, control, event handling, configuration,
    status querying, etc.
