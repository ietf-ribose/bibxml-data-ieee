    <abstract>This recommended practice is intended to serve in the preparation of standards that areprincipally concerned with the thermal endurance of EIM and simple combinations of suchmaterials, with the establishment of limiting temperatures of EIS, and with the provision of generalprinciples for thermal classification of EIS.</abstract>
