    <abstract>This is a standard for short range, wireless communication in the vicinity of, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans). It uses existing ISM bands as well as frequency bands approved by national medical and/or regulatory authorities. Support for quality of service, extremely low power, and data rates up to 10 Mbps is required while simultaneously complying with strict non-interference guidelines where needed. This standard considers effects on portable antennas due to the presence of a person (varying with male, female, skinny, heavy, etc.), radiation pattern shaping to minimize specific absorption rate into the body, and changes in characteristics as a result of the user motions.</abstract>
