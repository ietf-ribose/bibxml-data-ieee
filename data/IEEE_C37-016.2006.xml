    <abstract>This standard is applicable to ac circuit switchers designed for outdoor installation and for rated power frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz and rated maximum voltages of 15.5 kV through 245 kV. It is applicable only to three-pole circuit switchers for use in three-phase systems. This standard is also applicable to the operating devices of circuit switchers and to their auxiliary equipment.</abstract>
