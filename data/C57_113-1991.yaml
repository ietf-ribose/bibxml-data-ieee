abstract:
  content: The detection and measurement by the wide-band apparent charge method of
    partial discharges occurring in liquid-filled power transformers and shunt reactors
    during dielectric tests are covered. The standard covers the measuring instrument,
    calibrator characteristics, test circuits, calibration procedure, and partial
    discharge measurement during induced-voltage tests.<<ETX>>
