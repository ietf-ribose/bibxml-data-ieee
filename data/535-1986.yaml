abstract:
  content: Qualification methods for Class 1E lead storage batteries and racks to
    be used in nuclear power generating stations outside of primary containment are
    described. Principles and methods of qualification, qualification information,
    qualification by type testing, type tests and analysis procedures, and documentation
    are covered. Battery sizing, maintenance, capacity testing, installation, charging
    equipment, and other types of batteries that are beyond the scope of this standard
    are not considered.
