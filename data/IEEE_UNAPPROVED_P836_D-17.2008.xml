    <abstract>This recommended practice provides a guide to the conduct and analysis of precision centrifuge tests of linear accelerometers, covering each phase of the tests, beginning with the planning. Possible error sources and typical methods of data analysis are addressed. The intent is to provide those involved in centrifuge testing with a detailed understanding of the various factors affecting accuracy of measurement, both those associated with the centrifuge and those in the data collection process. Model equations are discussed, both for the centrifuge and for a typical linear accelerometer, each with the complexity needed to ccommodate the various identified characteristics and error sources in each. An iterative matrix equation solution is presented for deriving the various model equation coefficients for the accelerometer under test from the centrifuge test data.</abstract>
