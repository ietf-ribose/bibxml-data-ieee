    <abstract>This standard establishes electrical ratings and test requirements of cable joints used with extruded and laminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 2500 V to 500 000 V. It also defines a variety of common joint constructions. This standard is designed to provide uniform testing procedures that can be used by manufacturers and users to evaluate the ability of underground power cable joints to perform reliably in service.</abstract>
