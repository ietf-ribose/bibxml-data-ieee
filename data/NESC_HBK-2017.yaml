- content: 'The 2017 NESC(R) Handbook, Premier Edition, is an essential companion
    to the Code. This handbook includes text directly from Code which provides users
    an easy reference back to the code, ruling-by-ruling. It gives users insight into
    what lies behind the NESC''s rules and how to apply them. The Handbook was developed
    for use at many levels in the electric and communication industries, including
    those involved in system design, construction, maintenance, inspection, standards
    development and worker training. The Handbook also discusses how the NESC Committee
    has developed the rules in the Code and responded to change proposals during the
    past 100 years. This allows users to understand how questions they may have were
    dealt with in the past. The Premier Edition includes: Revising the purpose rule
    to include only the safeguarding of persons and utility facilities and clarifying
    the application rules. Deleting unused definitions and adding definitions for
    communication and supply space. Revising the substation impenetrable fence requirements.
    Adding an exception to exempt underground cable grounding requirements from the
    4 grounds in each mile rule under certain conditions. Revising and reorganizing
    the guy insulator placement rules along with eliminating the voltage transfer
    requirements associated with them. Requiring a 40 vertical clearance from communication
    cables in the communication space if a luminaire is not effectively grounded.
    Deleting the conductance requirement for underground insulating jacketed grounded
    neutral supply cables and revising the grounding and bonding rules for supply
    and communication cables in random separation installations. Revising and reorganizing
    the Grades of Construction Table 242-1 that will now include service drops. Revising
    the strength rules to require that all conductors be considered for damage due
    to Aeolian vibration. Revising the rules in Part 4 to align with changes made
    to 29 CFR by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).'
