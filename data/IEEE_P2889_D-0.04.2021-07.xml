    <abstract>Guidance on the definition of the incident power density in correlation with surface temperature elevation in the frequency range from 6 GHz to 300 GHz is provided. Using numerical simulations or measurement, this guide is also applicable to compliance assessment of wireless products operating in millimeter wave frequencies.</abstract>
