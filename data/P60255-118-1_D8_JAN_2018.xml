    <abstract>This standard provides continuation and further development of previous synchrophasor standards, notably the IEEE C37.118 series. It defines synchrophasor, frequency, and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) measurements as used in this technology. These definitions are in agreement with most research on and analysis of dynamic electric power system measurements, but may differ from those given in other contexts. Function and performance requirements are given for synchrophasor measurements. Tests, evaluation criteria, and error limits are provided to determine compliance with the requirements.</abstract>
