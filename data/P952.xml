    <abstract>Part I (clauses 3 through 8) of this standard is a specification format guide for the preparation of a single-axis interferometric fiber optic gyro (IFOG) specification. Part II (clauses 9 through 12) is a compilation of recommended procedures for testing an IFOG. These procedures, including test conditions to be considered, are derived from those currently in use.For a specific application, the test procedure should reflect the requirements of the specification;therefore, not all tests outlined in this standard need be included, nor are additional testsprecluded.</abstract>
