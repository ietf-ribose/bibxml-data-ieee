    <abstract>This guide presents test approaches and procedures for the components and the overall protection and control system functions. Test of equipment in the system protection scheme, associated communications equipment, auxiliary power supplies, and the control of power apparatus are addressed. Much of the testing emphasizes a bottom-up approach, in which the basic behavior of scheme components are verified first, followed by testing of interconnected components in a function-oriented assembly.</abstract>
