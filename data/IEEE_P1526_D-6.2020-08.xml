    <abstract>Tests to determine the performance of stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems and for verifying PV system design are presented in this recommended practice. These tests apply only to complete systems with a defined load. The methodology includes testing the system outdoors in prevailing conditions and indoors under simulated conditions. The tests are intended to assist designers, manufacturers, system integrators, system users, and laboratories that will conduct the tests. System safety and component reliability issues are not addressed in this recommended practice.</abstract>
