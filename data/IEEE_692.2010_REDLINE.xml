    <abstract>The standard provides criteria for the design, testing, and maintenance of security system equipment for nuclear power generating stations. Such equipment includes permanently or temporarily installed systems, subsystems, and components used by the security force for physical protection of the station against security threats. It includes equipment for security-related detection, assessment, surveillance, access control, communication, and data acquisition.</abstract>
