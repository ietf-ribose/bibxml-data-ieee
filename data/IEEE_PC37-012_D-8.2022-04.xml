    <abstract>Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers switching capacitive currents is provided. The application guide addresses the general theory of capacitive current switching; and the notions of restrike, re-ignition, non-sustained disruptive discharge (NSDD). Voltage factors used for single-phase testing as substitute for three-phase testing are explained. Application of circuit breakers for different network conditions and different capacitive loads (capacitor banks, cables, transmission lines, and filter banks) is treated.</abstract>
