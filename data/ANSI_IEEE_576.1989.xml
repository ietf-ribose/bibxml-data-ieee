    <abstract>Superseded by 576-2000. A guide to installation, splicing, termination, and field-proof testing of cable systems is provided. The aim is to avoid premature cable failure due to improper installation and mechanical damage during installation, and to provide a reference that can be specified for cable installations. This standard is not intended to be a design document; many of the problems of installation can be avoided by designing cable layouts with the installation limits of this recommended practice.</abstract>
