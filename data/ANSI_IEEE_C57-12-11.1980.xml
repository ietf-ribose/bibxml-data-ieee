    <abstract>New, large, oil-immersed power transformers with high-voltage windings rated 69--287 kV inclusive are primarily considered. Inspection on receipt, internal inspection, handling, assembly of fittings, vacuum treatment, filling with oil, tests, and field drying are covered. Appropriate sections of the guide may be applied to lower-voltage transformers when similar conditions and similar transformer construction exist, and may also be used in servicing older transformers that have been opened for maintenance or repair work.</abstract>
