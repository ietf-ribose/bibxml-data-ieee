    <abstract>The base IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature is extended by this standard to provide support for ECG annotation terminology. It may be used either in conjunction with other IEEE 11073 standards (e.g., ISO/IEEE 11073-10201:2001) or independently with other standards. The major subject areas addressed by the nomenclature include ECG beat annotations, wave component annotations, rhythm annotations, and noise annotations. Additional “global” and “per-lead” numeric observation identifiers, ECG lead systems, and additional ECG lead identifiers also are defined.</abstract>
