    <abstract>Procedures and test voltage values for acceptance and maintenance testing of electric submersible pump (ESP) cable systems are presented. This recommended practice applies to cable systems rated 3 kV and 5 kV (phase to phase) and is intended only for this special-purpose cable. The intent is to provide uniform test procedures and guidelines for evaluation of the test results.</abstract>
