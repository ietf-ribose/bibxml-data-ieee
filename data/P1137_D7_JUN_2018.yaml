abstract:
  content: Guidance for controlling or modifying the inductive environment and the
    susceptibility of affected wire line telecommunications facilities in order to
    operate within the acceptable levels of steady-state or surge induced voltages
    of the environmental interface (probe wire) defined by IEEE Std 776(TM) is provided
    in this Recommended Practice. Procedures for determining the source of the problem
    are given. Mitigation theory and philosophy are discussed, and mitigation devices
    are described. The application of typical mitigation apparatus are addressed.
    Advice for determining the best engineering solution is offered, and general safety
    considerations are discussed.
