    <abstract>This project develops a set of common functionality for the family of IEEE P1451 smart transducer interface standards. This functionality is independent of the physical communications media. It includes the basic functions required to control and manage smart transducers, common communications protocols, and media-independent Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) formats. It defines a set of implementation-independent application programming interfaces (API). This project does not specify signal conditioning and conversion, physical media, or how the TEDS data are used in applications.</abstract>
