    <abstract>The purpose of this procedure is to define uniform acceptable methods for making tests to determine the performance of alternating-current, 400-cycle-per-second, aircraft-type induction electric motors. Aircraft-type machines are subjected to environmental operating conditions much more stringent than those normally encountered by commercial type machines and yet minimum weight and the utmost reliability are essential to the application. Weight reduction is normally achieved by reduction of life expectancy, thus making direct measurements a necessity in order to determine that reliability is commensurate with aircraft practices. It is recognized that there may be acceptable methods for making tests other than those included herein. However, the methods in this publication are intended to serve as a standard for both manufacturers and users of aircraft motors. It is intended that the standardizing of test procedures will Iead to coincident test data regardless of which party conducts the test.</abstract>
