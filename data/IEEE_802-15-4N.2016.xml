    <abstract>The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of the Peoples Republic of China has approved the 174-216 MHz, 407-425 MHz, and 608-630 MHz bands for medical information transmission. China medical band (CMB) devices operating within these bands conform to a set of rules specified in MIIT Doc 423-2005, which restricts use of the band to only medical, non-voice use under direction of a healthcare practitioner, among other requirements. A physical layer (PHY) for devices operating on Chinese approved bands for medical signals is defined in this amendment.</abstract>
