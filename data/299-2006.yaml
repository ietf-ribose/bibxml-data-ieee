abstract:
- content: Uniform measurement procedures and techniques are provided for determining
    the effectiveness of electromagnetic shielding enclosures at frequencies from
    9 kHz to 18 GHz (extendable to 50 Hz and 100 GHz, respectively) for enclosures
    having all dimension greater than or equal to 2.0 m. The types of enclosures covered
    include, but are not limited to, single-shield or double-shield structures of
    various construction, such as bolted demountable, welded, or integral with a building;
    and made of materials such as steel plate, copper or aluminum sheet, screening,
    hardware cloth, metal foil, or shielding fabrics.
