abstract:
  content: Mobile and wearable devices are increasingly being developed for health
    care purposes. Mobile health (mHealth) data encompasses personal health data collected
    from sensors and mobile applications. Standardizing mHealth data and metadata
    will improve the ease and alignment accuracy of aggregating data across multiple
    mobile health sources (semantic interoperability) and will reduce the costs of
    using this data for biomedical discovery, improving health, and managing disease.
    This IEEE 1752 standard defines specifications for standardized representations
    of quantitative sleep and physical activity measures, minimum metadata and subjective
    reports (surveys). The purpose of this standard is to provide standard semantics
    to enable meaningful description, exchange, sharing, and use of such mHealth data.
    Data and associated metadata complying to this standard will be sufficiently clear
    and complete to support their use for a broad set of consumer health, biomedical
    research, and clinical care needs. (This standard incorporates open source. See
    https://opensource.ieee.org/standards/project/)
