abstract:
- content: All of the terms and definitions in this document have been taken from
    current IEEE standards on nuclear power generating stations. The source of each
    definition is indicated by a number in brackets immediately following the definition
    in Section 1, and full listings of each standard follow in Section 2. As defined
    herein, the terms are restricted to the manner in which they have been employed
    in mentioned standards, and the definitions may not, in all cases, be applicable
    for broader usage. However, because the IEEE standards on nuclear power generating
    stations have had wide acceptance within both government and industry, the terms,
    as used in these documents, have come into broad usage by many persons who neither
    need the standards nor have ready access to them. Since these terms are not included
    in American National Standard Glossary of Terms in Nuclear Science and Technology,
    Nl.1-1967, the present document has been published as a convenient method of supplementing
    that standard.
