    <abstract>Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) expulsion-type distribution-class fuses, fuse cutouts, fuse disconnecting switches, their associated fuse links, disconnecting cutouts, and accessories for these devices are covered. All of these devices are intended for use on alternating current distribution systems. These include open and enclosed types of fuses and fuse cutouts and fuse disconnecting switches, as well as the fuse links of the type used exclusively with these devices; also open-link types of fuses, cutouts and their associated fuse links, open and enclosed types of disconnecting cutouts, fuse supports, fuse mountings and fuse hooks of the type used exclusively with distribution-class fuses, fuse cutouts, fuse disconnecting switches and disconnecting cutouts, fuseholders and removable switch blades of the type used exclusively with distribution-class fuse supports and mounting brackets used for distribution-class equipment and other accessories.</abstract>
