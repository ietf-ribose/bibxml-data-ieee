abstract:
  content: The design requirements for a fiber-optic serial interconnect protocol,
    topology, and media is established. The application target for this standard is
    the interconnection of multiple aerospace sensors, processing resources, bulk
    storage resources, and communications resources onboard aerospace platforms. This
    standard is for subsystem interconnection, as opposed to intra-backplane connection.
