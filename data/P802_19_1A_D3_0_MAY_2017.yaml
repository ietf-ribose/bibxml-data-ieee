abstract:
  content: The network-based coexistence information exchange among networks and devices
    to enable network-based coexistence management is defined in this amendment to
    IEEE 802.19.1-2014. This amendment specifies procedures and protocols for collection
    and exchange of coexistence information of heterogeneous networks, spectrum resource
    measurements and network performance metrics, such as packet error ratio, delay,
    etc., and information elements and data structures to capture coexistence information.
