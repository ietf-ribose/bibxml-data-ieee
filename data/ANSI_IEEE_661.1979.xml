    <abstract>To describe a practical and reproducible method of determining the loudness ratings of telephone connections. Loudness ratings may be measured directly using appropriate test instruments and facilities, as specified in this standard, or may be computed using the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the connection measured in accordance with IEEE Std 269-1971. .</abstract>
