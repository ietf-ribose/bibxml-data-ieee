abstract:
  content: This report summarizes with general considerations in grounding synchronous
    generator systems and discusses the factors to be considered in the selection
    of a grounding class and the application of grounding methods. The guidelines
    apply to both the large and small generators found in electric utility systems.
    It should be borne in mind by the user that this report is intended solely as
    a guide. Statements are necessarily of a general nature and, therefore, do not
    take into account the requirements of special situations that can differ considerably
    from those discussed.<<ETX>>
