abstract:
  content: The recommended practice provides component function identifiers that,
    when used with related recommended practices concerning unique identification
    principles and definitions, implementation instructions, and system descriptions,
    provides a basis for uniquely identifying systems, structures, and components
    of nuclear and fossil-fueled power plant projects (electric power generating stations)
    and related facilities. This recommended practice is a part of a series of recommended
    practices, entitled the Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS), the purpose
    of which is to present a common language of communication that will permit a user
    to correlate a system, structure, or component with that of another organization
    for the purposes of reporting, comparison, or general communication. A significant
    feature of this concept is that the unique identification code identifies the
    function at the component level but does not identify the hardware itself.<<ETX>>
