    <abstract>Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00TM-2006 and other standards applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers are described. Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. This standard covers resistance measurements, polarity and phaserelation tests, ratio tests, no-load-loss and excitation current measurements, impedance and load loss measurements, dielectric tests, temperature tests, short-circuit tests, audible sound level measurements, and calculated data.</abstract>
