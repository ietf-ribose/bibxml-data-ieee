    <abstract>The interoperability and compliance testing for IEEE 1901.1 products built, in which physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of the medium frequency band (less than 12 MHz) broadband power line communication technology for smart grid applications (SGPLC) based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), is specified in this standard. The corresponding PLC application scenarios and test environment are introduced, and the PHY/MAC test cases and test scenarios are provided. The procedures for compliance, interoperability, and certification of IEEE Std 1901.1(TM) are specified in this standard.</abstract>
