abstract:
  content: Superseded by 1050-1996. Guidance for the design of grounding systems for
    instrumentation and control equipment specific to large central generating stations
    is provided. The goal is to achieve both a suitable level of protection for personnel
    and equipment and suitable electric noise immunity for signal ground references.
    Requirements for the grounding of systems associated with the interconnection
    of the station to adjacent substations are considered, since these are a large
    source of electrical noise. Both ideal theoretical methods and accepted practices
    in the electric utility industry are presented. Applications relating to advanced
    energy storage and conversion technologies (photovoltaics, fuel cells, etc.) are
    not considered. .
