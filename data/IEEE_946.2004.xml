    <abstract>Revision of IEEE Std 946-1992. Guidance for the design of the DC auxiliary power systems for nuclear and non-nuclear power generating stations is provided by this recommended practice. The components of the DC auxiliary power system addressed by this recommended practice include lead-acid storage batteries, static battery chargers, and distribution equipment. Guidance for selecting the quantity and types of equipment, the equipment ratings, interconnections, instrumentation, control and protection is also provided.</abstract>
