    <abstract>Uniform procedures are established for the measurement of radio noise generated by corona from overhead power lines with meters that conform to ANSI C63.2-1980. The measurement procedures are also valid for other power-line noise sources such as gaps and harmonics; however, most of the precautionary information, analys is, and data plotting techniques were written and developed primarily for corona discharges. The procedures are not valid for measuring transient radio noise sources that occur during breaker or disconnect switching operations. Procedures are suggested for measurements in and near substations. This standard is applicable to both AC and DC transmission lines and substations.</abstract>
