    <abstract>This standard covers certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics and takes into consideration certain safety features of single-phase, 60 Hz., mineral-oil-immersed, selfcooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers. These transformers are rated 167 kVA and smaller, with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 volts and below, and with low voltages of 240/120 volts. These transformers are generally used for step-down purposes from an underground primary cable supply. This standard covers the connector, bushing and terminal arrangements for radial or loop feed systems. This standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer.</abstract>
