    <abstract>The purpose of this ANSI/IEEE proposed recommended practice is to give a common basis of comparison among electronic voltmeters offered for general purpose applications. It is recommended that all manufacturers offering instruments for general applications supply the information outlined. For the purpose of these specifications, general-purpose voltmeters do not include instruments which are primarily intended for measurement of pulses or similar discontinuous waveforms, or instruments of the electrometer type which are designed to provide an extremely high input resistance (10/sup 10/ ohms or more). It is recognized that additional information should be supplied with instruments in these and other special groups which manufacturers should not be asked to supply when they are offering instruments for more general applications.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
