abstract:
  content: In this IEEE Standard a test method is provided to qualify various essentially
    nonvolatile, highly viscous fluids or solid materials at 90/spl deg/C, for use
    with high-voltage cable shields and jackets. A suggested alternative test method
    for more fluid and more volatile materials is also provided.
