    <abstract>A definition of the requirements placed upon providers of a POSIX . Conformance Test Suite for the POSIX.2 standard (ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993, IEEE/ANSI Std. 1003.2-1992) is provided. These requirements consist of a list of assertions defining those aspects of POSIX.2 that are to be tested and the associ-ated test methods that are to be used in performing those tests. This standard is primarily aimed at test suite providers but it also defines to POSIX.2 implementors those aspects of the standard that will be verified by a conformance test suite.</abstract>
