    <abstract>This recommended practice covers the selection and application of power distribution apparatus used in industrial and commercial power systems. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience with this equipment. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.</abstract>
