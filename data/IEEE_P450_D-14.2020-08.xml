    <abstract>Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage batteries used for standby service are provided. Guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced is also provided. This recommended practice is applicable to standby service stationary applications where a charger maintains the battery fully charged and supplies the dc loads.</abstract>
