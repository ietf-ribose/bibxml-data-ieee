    <abstract>The media access control characteristics for the Demand Priority access method are specified. The layer management, physical layers, and media that support this access method are also specified. Layer and sublayer interface specifications are aligned to the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model and ISO/IEC 8802 models. Specifications for 100 Mb/s operation over 100 = balanced cable (twisted-pair) category 3 through 5, 150 = shielded balanced cable, and fibre optic media are included.</abstract>
