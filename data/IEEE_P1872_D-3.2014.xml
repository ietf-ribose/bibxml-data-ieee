    <abstract>A core ontology that specifies the main, most general concepts, relations, and axioms of robotics and automation (R&amp;A) is defined in this standard, which is intended as a reference for knowledge representation and reasoning in robots, as well as a formal reference vocabulary for communicating knowledge about R&amp;A between robots and humans. This standard is composed of a core ontology about R&amp;A, called CORA, together with other ontologies that give support to CORA.</abstract>
