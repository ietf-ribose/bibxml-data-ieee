    <abstract>This standard is intended: (1) To define a rational, general-purpose interface system for designers of new computer system components that will ensure their compatibility with present and future IEEE Std 696 computer systems.(2) To provide the microprocessor computer-system user with compatible device families which will communicate in an unambiguous way without modification, from which a modularly expandable computer system may be constructed.(3) To enable the interconnection of independently manufactured devices into a single system.(4) To specify terminology and definitions related to the system.(5) To define a system with the minimum number of restrictions on the performance characteristics of devices connected to the system.(6) To define a system that, of itself, is of relatively low cost, and allows the interconnection of low-cost devices.(7) To define a system that is easy to use.</abstract>
