    <abstract>This standard provides recommendations and requirements for the design and applications of Power Electronics in Landbased (Onshore) and Marine (Offshore) Electrical Power Systems. It covers a wide range of power electronics equipment with aggregated power ratings at and above 100 kW with voltages equal or less than 52KV AC or DC. It describes existing engineering practices, analytical methods, and performance characteristics. Applicable international and local standards are referenced with appropriate guidance to provide users of the standard with correct criteria for design, testing and maintenance necessary for reliable operation of integrated power systems.</abstract>
