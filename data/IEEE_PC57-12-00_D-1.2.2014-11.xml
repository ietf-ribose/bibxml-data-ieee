    <abstract>Electrical and mechanical requirements for liquid-immersed distribution and powertransformers, and autotransformers and regulating transformers; single- and polyphase, withvoltages of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding, are set forth. This standard is a basisfor the establishment of performance, and limited electrical and mechanical interchangeabilityrequirements of equipment are described; it is also a basis for assistance in the proper selectionof such equipment. The requirements in this standard apply to all liquid-immersed distribution,power, and regulating transformers except the following: instrument transformers, step voltageand induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialtytransformers, grounding transformers, mobile transformers, and mine transformers.</abstract>
