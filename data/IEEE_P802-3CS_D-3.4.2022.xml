    <abstract>This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-202x extends the operation of Ethernet passive optical networks (EPONs) to Super-PON optical subscriber access networks. Super-PON supports an increased optical reach of up to 50 km and an expanded customer coverage of up to 1024 subscribers over a point-to-multipoint passive optical distribution network (ODN) through wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). The defining element of a Super-PON optical distribution network (ODN) is the presence of a passive wavelength router that determines the channels supported by the ODN. This standard specifies the Super-PON Reconciliation Sublayer (RS), Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS), Physical Media Attachment (PMA) sublayer, and Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer at a MAC data rate of 10 Gb/s in the downstream direction and of 10 Gb/s or 2.5 Gb/s in the upstream direction.</abstract>
