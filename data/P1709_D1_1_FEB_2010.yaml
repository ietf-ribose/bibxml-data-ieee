abstract:
  content: This standard recommends guidelines to specify, procure, design, 1 manufacture
    and develop manuals, safety procedures, practices and procedures for effective
    maintenance of Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) electrical power systems. Recommendations
    are made for analytical methods, preferred interconnection interfaces and performance
    characteristics for reliable integration of MVDC Electrical components into the
    Ship MVDC electrical power systems.
