abstract:
  content: Specification and test requirements for a single-axis ring laser gyro (RLG)
    for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement measuring
    systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. A standard specification
    format guide for the preparation of a single-axis RLG is provided. A compilation
    of recommended procedures for testing an RLG, derived from those presently used
    in the industry, is also provided.
