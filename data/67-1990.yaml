abstract:
  content: Superseded by IEEE Std 67-2006 General recommendations for the operation,
    loading, and maintenance of turbine-driven synchronous generators having cylindrical
    rotors are provided. The manufacturer's and user's responsibility is discussed,
    and the classification of generators and the basis on which they are rated are
    covered. Mechanical considerations are also addressed.
