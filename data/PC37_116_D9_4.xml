    <abstract>To provide a guide for the application of protective relays on transmission-line series capacitor banks. The guide will provide alternative approaches to the design, testing, and maintenance of protective relays based on the latest knowledge and the application experience of the industry. The guide will also cover issues related to the reliability of the protective relay system.</abstract>
