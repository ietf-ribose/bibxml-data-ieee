    <abstract>This recommended practice is for single or multiconductor cables, with or without metal armor and/or jacket, and rated 300 V to 35 kV AC (RMS phase-to-phase) or up to 2000 V DC, intended to be installed aboard marine vessels, fixed and floating offshore facilities, and in accordance with industry installation standards and the regulations of the authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ). The recommendations define what is considered good engineering practice with reference to the reliability and durability of the cable.</abstract>
