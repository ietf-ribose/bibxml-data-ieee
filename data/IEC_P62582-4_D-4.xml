    <abstract>This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 specifies methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using oxidation induction techniques in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements for sample preparation, the measurement system and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results.</abstract>
