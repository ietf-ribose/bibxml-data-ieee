    <abstract>These recommendations apply to loudspeakers and loudspeaker systems. The recommendations define terms associated with loudspeakers and their testing, recommend methods of testing on which there is general agreement, and indicate preferred methods of presenting information regarding their characteristics. They involve physical, steady-state measurements only. Methods of measurement are stated in such a manner as to constitute recommendations to competent technical personnel acquainted with current practices in electroacoustical measurements.</abstract>
