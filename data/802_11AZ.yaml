abstract:
  content: This amendment defines modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 medium access
    control layer (MAC) and physical layers (PHY). It enables absolute and relative
    position estimation with higher-accuracy executing on the same PHY-type. Further,
    it reduces existing wireless medium utilization and power consumption, is scalable
    to dense deployments, and includes security features.
