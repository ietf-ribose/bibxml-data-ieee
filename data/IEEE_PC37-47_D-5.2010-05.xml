    <abstract>Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution Current-limiting fuses and disconnecting switches and associated accessories with rated voltages from 1 kV through 38 kV are established. All of these devices are intended for use on alternating current distribution systems. These include distribution current-limiting fuses, supports, mountings, fuse hooks, and tongs, all of the type used exclusively with distribution current limiting fuses used on power systems and also those used in enclosure packages. Current-limiting fuses for capacitor application are covered in C37.43.</abstract>
