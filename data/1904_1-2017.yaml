abstract:
  content: The system-level requirements needed to ensure service-level, multi-vendor
    interoperability of Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON) equipment is described.
    The existing IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.1 standards, which ensure the interoperability
    at the Physical Layer(PHY) and Data Link Layer, are complemented by the specifications.
    Specifically included in this specification are - EPON system-level interoperability
    specifications covering equipment functionality, traffic engineering, and service-level
    quality of service/class of service (QoS/CoS) mechanisms; - Management specifications
    covering equipment management, service management, and EPON power&amp;#8208;saving
    mechanism.
