    <abstract>The application and performance requirements for a low-voltage uninterruptible power supply system used for service in power generating stations are defined. Application requirements such as load information and service conditions, routine testing requirements for inverters with or without rectifiers/chargers, and transfer switches are all covered. Only semiconductor AC to AC converter systems with a DC electric energy storage capability are considered. Particular attention is given to nuclear power generating stations.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
