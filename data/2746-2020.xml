    <abstract>This guide identifies the mechanisms and analytic approach for ac interference effects on conductive linear facilities due to the operation of co-located electric transmission lines. The common mechanisms for ac interference such as magnetic inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, and conductive voltage transfer through soil are discussed. Included are general guidelines and considerations for performing detailed ac interference analyses, with sections specific to the analysis of co-located pipeline and railroad facilities. This guide does not dictate specific compliance limits, direct when an ac interference analysis must be performed, or cover other issues that may need to be considered in joint-use corridors, such as effects due to lightning striking the line or dc corrosion on structures.</abstract>
