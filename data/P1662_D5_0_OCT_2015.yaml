abstract:
  content: This standard provides recommendations and requirements for the design
    and applications of Power Electronics in Landbased (Onshore) and Marine (Offshore)
    Electrical Power Systems. It covers a wide range of power electronics equipment
    with aggregated power ratings at and above 100 kW with voltages equal or less
    than 52KV AC or DC. It describes existing engineering practices, analytical methods,
    and performance characteristics. Applicable international and local standards
    are referenced with appropriate guidance to provide users of the standard with
    correct criteria for design, testing and maintenance necessary for reliable operation
    of integrated power systems.
