    <abstract>This guide applies only to the United States and its territories. Electrical equipment manufacturers, owners, operators, and maintenance personnel who utilize polychlorinated biphenyls or conduct maintenance or manufacturing operations through which these can be encountered are subject to the new regulations. There are requirements for identification, labeling, and servicing equipment, and handling and disposal of equipment and materials. There are also requirements for handling spills and leaks and for keeping comprehensive records. The specific purpose of this guide is to cover in detail the procedures for handling askarels and mineral insulating oil that contain PCBs, and to describe the analytical procedures for measuring them.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
