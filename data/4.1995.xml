    <abstract>This standard establishes standard methods to measure high-voltage and basic testing techniques, so far as they are generally applicable, to all types of apparatus for alternating voltages, direct voltages, lightning impulse voltags, switching impulse voltages, and impulse currents. This revision implements many new procedures to improve accuracy, provide greater flexibility, and address practical problems associated with high-voltage measurements.</abstract>
