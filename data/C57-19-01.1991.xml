    <abstract>Superseded by C57.19.01-2000 Electrical, dimensional, and related requirements for outdoor power-class apparatus bushings that have basic impulse insulation levels of 110 kV and higher are covered. Specific values for dimensional and related requirements that are to be interpreted, measured, or tested in accordance with IEEE C57.19.00-1991 are provided. Bushings covered by this standard are intended for use as components of oil-filled transformers, oil-filled reactors, and oil circuit breakers</abstract>
