    <abstract>Meshed Tree Bridging protocol ensures that bridged 1 network constituents receive high reliability in frame delivery in the event of link or bridge failures. Meshed Tree Bridging protocol is based on the meshed tree algorithm that allows for simultaneous construction and maintenance of multiple trees or tree branches from a single root. In the event of tree branch failures due to link or bridge failures, another pre-constructed and maintained branch exists as an immediate fallback. Recovery and tree pruning times in meshed tree bridging is minimal. Multiple roots should be pre-assigned to construct multiple distinguishable meshed trees from each root. In the event of a root bridge failure, the standby root and its meshed tree provides loop-free paths for frame forwarding with minimal recovery delays.</abstract>
