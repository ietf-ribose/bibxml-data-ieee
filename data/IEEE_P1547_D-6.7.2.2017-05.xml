    <abstract>The technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection and interoperability between utility electric power systems (EPSs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) are the focus of this standard. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It also includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests. The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of DER, including synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters and will be sufficient for most installations. The criteria and requirements are applicable to all DER technologies interconnected to EPSs at typical primary and/or secondary distribution voltages. Installation of DER on radial primary and secondary distribution systems is the main emphasis of this document, although installation of DERs on primary and secondary network distribution systems is considered. This standard is written considering that the DER is a 60 Hz source.</abstract>
