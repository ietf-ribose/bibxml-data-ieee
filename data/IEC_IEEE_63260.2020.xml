    <abstract>A structured framework for the incorporation of human reliability analysis (HRA) into probabilistic risk assessments (PRAs) is provided in this guide. To enhance the analysis of human/system interactions in PRAs, to help ensure reproducible conclusions, and to standardize the documentation of such assessments are the purposes of this guide. To do this, a specific HRA framework is developed from standard practices. The HRA framework is neutral with respect to specific HRA methods.</abstract>
