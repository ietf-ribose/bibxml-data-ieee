    <abstract>Superseded by 12207:2008(E) (IEEE Std 12207-2008). ISO/IEC 12207 provides a common framework for developing and managing software. IEEE/EIA 12207.0 consists of the clarifications, additions, and changes accepted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) as formulated by a joint project of the two organizations. IEEE/EIA 12207.2 provides implementation consideration guidance for the normative clauses of IEEE/EIA 12207.0. The guidance is based on software industry experience with the life cycle processes presented in IEEE/EIA 12207.0.</abstract>
