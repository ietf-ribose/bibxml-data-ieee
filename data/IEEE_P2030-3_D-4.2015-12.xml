    <abstract>This standard applies to applications of electric energy storage equipment and systems (electric energy storage equipment and systems, ESS) for electric power systems (electric power systems, EPS). It provides the testing items and procedures, including type test, production test, installation evaluation, commissioning test at site and periodic test, in order to verify whether ESS applied in EPS meets the safety and reliability requirements of EPS. This standard is established for users including grid operators, ESS manufactures and ESS operators.</abstract>
