    <abstract>This standard applies to all types of line-commutated semiconductor power converters employing monocrystalline semiconductor thyristors or diodes, as used in industrial motor-drive applications requiring adjustable direct voltage for dc motor armature or field, or adjustable voltage and frequency in the case of ac motor drives (cycloconverter). It covers thyristor converter circuits, general requirements, test procedures, general recommendations for loading and operating converter units, and thyristor converter transformers. Although written primarily around the requirements of motor drives needing sufficient power to utilize multiphase power converters, this standard is applicable with reasonable interpretation to all line-commutated power converters used in industrial motor-drive applications.</abstract>
