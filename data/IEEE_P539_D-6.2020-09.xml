    <abstract>Definitions and usage of terms used in the measurement and analysis of corona and field effects of overhead power lines are presented in this standard. Correlation between measurements from equipment to standard terms is defined. Weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog are defined and their measurement standards discussed. The intent is to assist in correlating standard terms found in literature and requirements to standard engineering practice.</abstract>
