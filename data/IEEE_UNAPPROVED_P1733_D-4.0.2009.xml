    <abstract>This standard specifies the protocol, data encapsulations, connection management 1 and presentation time procedures used to ensure interoperability between audio and video based 2 end stations that use standard networking services provided by all IEEE 802 networks meeting 3 QoS requirements for time-sensitive applications by leveraging the Real-time Transport Protocol 4 (RTP) family of protocols and IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocols.</abstract>
