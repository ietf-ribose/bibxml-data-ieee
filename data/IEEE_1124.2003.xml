    <abstract>Guidelines are provided for evaluating and mitigating harmonic induction effects from high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines on the adjacent telephone communication lines. Specifically, this guide presents methodology and approach for a) Determining the number of wireline communication circuits that will be affected by unacceptable interference and cost-effective remedial measures; and b) Computing interference levels that would result with various practical dc filter/smoothing reactor designs and the costs of these filters.</abstract>
