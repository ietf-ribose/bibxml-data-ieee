  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">IEEE Std 323-1974, Standard for Qualifying Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, was developed to provide guidance for demonstrating and documenting the adequacy of electrical equipment used in all Class 1E and interface systems. This standard, IEEE Std 535-1979, was developed to provide specific methods and type test procedures for lead storage batteries in adherence to IEEE Std 323-1974. Adherence to this standard may not suffice for assuring public health and safety because it is the integrated performance of the electrical systems of the station that limits the consequence of accidents. Each applicant has the responsibility to assure himself and others that this document, if used, is pertinent to his application and that the integrated performance of his station is adequate. This document describes qualification methods for Class 1E lead storage batteries and racks to be used in nuclear power generating stations outside of primary containment. Qualification required in ANSI/IEEE Std 279-1971 and IEEE Std 308-1978, can be demonstrated by using the procedures provided in this standard in accordance with IEEE Std 323-1974. Battery sizing, maintenance, capacity testing, installation, charging equipment and consideration of other type batteries are beyond the scope of this standard.</abstract>
