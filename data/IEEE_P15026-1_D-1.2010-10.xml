    <abstract>This Technical Report defines terms and establishes an extensive and organized set of concepts and their relationships thereby establishing a basis for shared understanding of the concepts and principles central to ISO/IEC 15026 across its user communities. It provides information to users of the other parts of this International Standard including the use of each part and the combined use of multiple parts. Coverage of assurance for a service being operated and managed on an ongoing basis is not covered in this International Standard.</abstract>
