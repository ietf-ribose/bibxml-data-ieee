    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE Std 693-2005 Recommendations for seismic design of substations, including qualification of each equipmenttype, are discussed. Design recommendations consist of seismic criteria, qualification methods and levels,structural capacities, performance requirements for equipment operation, installation methods, anddocumentation.</abstract>
