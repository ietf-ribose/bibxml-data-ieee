abstract:
  content: This handbook, in its Chinese version, is essential for Chinese speaking
    communities and assist in areas that need well-defined regulations related to
    electrical safety for power, energy transmission and distribution, and communications
    industries. Important to power and energy engineers, as well as to communications
    providers, such as internet, phone et al. The handbook includes text directly
    from the NESC 2017 edition, which provides users an easy reference back to the
    code, ruling-by-ruling, all in Chinese; plus, subject matter expert commentary
    also in Chinese. It gives users insight into what lies behind the NESC's rules
    and how to apply them. The Handbook was developed for use at many levels in the
    electric and communication industries, including those involved in system design,
    construction, maintenance, inspection, standards development and worker training.
    The Handbook also discusses how the NESC Committee has developed the rules in
    the Code and responded to change proposals during the past 100 years. This allows
    users to understand how questions they may have dealt with in the past.
