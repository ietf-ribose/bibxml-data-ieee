- content: A common framework for extending the software life cycle processes of IEEE/EIA
    Std 12207.0-1996 to include the systematic practice of software reuse is provided.
    This standard specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to be applied during
    each phase of the software life cycle to enable a software product to be constructed
    from reusable assets. It also specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to
    enable the identification, construction, maintenance, and management of assets
    supplied
