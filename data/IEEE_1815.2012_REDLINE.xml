    <abstract>The DNP3 protocol structure, functions, and interoperable application options (subset levels) are specified. The simplest application level is intended for low-cost distribution feeder devices, and the most complex for full-featured systems. The appropriate level is selected to suit the functionality required in each device. The protocol is suitable for operation on a variety of communication media consistent with the makeup of most electric power communication systems.</abstract>
