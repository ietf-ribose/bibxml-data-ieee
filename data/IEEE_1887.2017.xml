    <abstract>Traction power systems experience some of the most extreme variations in local power loads as compared to most other large scale electric power supply networks. These variations create challenges in the construction of reliable electric power delivery systems and in the performance of the rolling stock dependent on power supplied by the system. A solution is offered by energy storage by smoothing out these power variations, absorbing energy as system voltage rises, and delivering energy as voltage drops. Engineers are helped by this guide to identify where these solutions can provide the greatest benefits, design solutions with the greatest impact, and quantify the costs and benefits of deploying new solutions.</abstract>
