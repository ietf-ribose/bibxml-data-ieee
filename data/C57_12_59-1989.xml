    <abstract>Protective devices, such as relays and fuses, have well-defined operating characteristics that relate fault magnitude to operating time. It is desirable that these characteristic curves be coordinated with comparable curves applicable to dry-type transformers that relate duration and fault magnitude to withstand capability. This guide sets forth recommendations believed essential for the application of overcurrent protective devices applied to limit the exposure time of dry-type transformers to short-circuit currents. This guide is not intended to imply overload capability.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
