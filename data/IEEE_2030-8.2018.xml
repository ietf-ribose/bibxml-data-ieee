    <abstract>A set of testing procedures that enable verification, quantification of performance, and comparison of the performance with expected minimum requirements of the different functions of the microgrid controller are developed in this standard. The functions tested are microgrid controller functions that are common to the control of all microgrids regardless of topology, configuration, or jurisdiction. It aims to present metrics for a comparison of the control functions required from both the microgrid operator and the Distribution System Operator (DSO). This standard is functionalitydriven and focuses on a modular approach to the implementation of the functional requirements.</abstract>
