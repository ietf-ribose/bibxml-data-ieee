abstract:
  content: Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorders (MVEDRs) collect, record, store and
    export data related to motor vehicle pre-defined events in usage history. This
    standard defines a protocol for MVEDR output data compatibility and export protocols
    of MVEDR data elements. This standard defines a Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorder
    Connector Lockout Apparatus (MVEDRCLA) and a Near Field Communication (NFC) protocol
    of safeguarding access to a vehicle's event data recorder (EDR) data by securing
    the vehicle output diagnostic a link connector (DLC) and establishing a chain
    of custody link. This standard is without prejudice to requirements of national
    or regional laws related to privacy, data protection and personal data processing.
