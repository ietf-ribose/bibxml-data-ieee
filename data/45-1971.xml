    <abstract>These Marine Recommendations have been drawn up to serve as a guide for the equipment of merchant vessels with an electric plant system and electric apparatus for lighting, signaling, communication, power, and propulsion. They indicate what is considered good engineering practice with reference to safety of the personnel and of the ship itself as well as reliability and durability of the apparatus; it is not intended, however, that improvements, which may be developed from time to time, should be excluded.</abstract>
