    <abstract>This standard provides continuation and further development of previous synchrophasor standards,notably the IEEE C37.118 series. It defines synchrophasor, frequency, and rate of change offrequency (ROCOF) measurements as used in this technology. These definitions are in agreementwith most research on and analysis of dynamic electric power system measurements, but may differfrom those given in other contexts. Function and performance requirements are given forsynchrophasor measurements. Tests, evaluation criteria, and error limits are provided to determinecompliance with the requirements.</abstract>
