    <abstract>This part of the standard provides recommendations for summarizing the performance and theexpected uncertainty of the reflection coefficient of rectangular-waveguide apertures and interfaces for 110 GHz and above. The information provided also facilitates the development of a complete uncertainty analysis for the performance of rectangular waveguide interfaces. For example, it includes the dimensional information essential for calculating the uncertainty of both reflection and transmission coefficients through interfaces provided by different manufactures if both follow the recommendations of this Part 3 of the standard.</abstract>
