    <abstract>This guide describes methods for selecting the appropriate type of valve-regulated, immobilized-electrolyte, recombinant lead-acid battery for any of a variety of stationary float applications. Installation, maintenance, sizing, and consideration of battery types other than valve- regulated lead-acid batteries, are beyond the scope of this guide. Design of the dc system and sizing of the dc battery charger(s) are also beyond the scope of this guide.</abstract>
