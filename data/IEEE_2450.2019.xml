    <abstract>Baseline performance requirements and associated test procedures for down-the-road (DTR) traffic radar speed-measuring devices are established in this standard. Modulated or unmodulated continuous-wave (CW) microwave energy is transmitted, the signal reflected from moving vehicles within the microwave beam is received, the Doppler shift of the reflected signal to measure and display the speed of the vehicle that is being tracked, and if applicable, the speed of the patrol vehicle, is processed by these DTR radar devices. Unmanned radar speed-measuring devices, automated speed enforcement, or DTR radar range measurements are not covered in this standard.</abstract>
