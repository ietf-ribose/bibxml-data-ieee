    <abstract>This guide recommends safety measures that should be taken to help keep passive optical elements and optical fiber cables used in high power industrial laser systems from being affected by optical, opto-machines and related effects. The guide is intended to be used by laser system manufacturers, installers and service providers and end-users. The purpose is to help reduce the possibility of injury by reducing radiation risks and to improve control of the laser radiation hazards through protective features of laser transmission systems.</abstract>
