abstract:
  content: This standard defines the protocol and compatible network equipment for
    optical wireless communications and its operation as an optical wireless personal
    area network (OWPAN) supporting data rates of multiple Gbit/s for wireless specialty
    applications. The standard defines a medium access control (MAC) layer operating
    in beacon-enabled or non-beacon-enabled mode and three physical layers (PHYs)
    enabling low complexity, low power, and high throughput.
