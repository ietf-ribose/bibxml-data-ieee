    <abstract>Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets and headsets are covered in this standard. The methods may also be applicable to a wide variety of other communications equipment, including cordless, wireless and mobile communications devices. Measurement results may be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized basis. Application is in the frequency range from 100 to 8,500 Hz. This edition incorporates IEEE 269a-2007, "IEEE Std. for Methods for Measuring Transmission Performance of Analog and Digital Telephone Sets, Handsets, and Headsets, Amendment 1." Other substantive changes have been made since the 2002 edition</abstract>
