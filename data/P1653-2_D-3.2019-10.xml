    <abstract>The design, manufacturing, and testing unique to the application of uncontrolled semiconductor power rectifiers for direct current (dc) supplied transportation substation applications up to 1500 V dc nominal output is covered in this standard. The standard is intended to address traction power substation rectifiers that are to be provided as part of a rectifier transformer unit or that are to be provided separately. Application information and extensive definitions of related technical terms are included.</abstract>
