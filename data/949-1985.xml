    <abstract>The purpose of this standard is to define a format for the transmission of files and their attributes between computer systems independent of the medium of transmission. It is intended that any information medium capable of representing a consecutive sequence of 8-bit bytes should be adaptable to the format specified in this standard. The format is designed to facilitate the human interface to file selection from transmissions by foreign systems.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
