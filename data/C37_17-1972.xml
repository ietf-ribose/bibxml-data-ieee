    <abstract>This standard pertains to direct-acting overcurrent, reverse-current, and undervoltage tripdevices of both the electromechanical and ac solid-state types integral with low-voltage ac andgeneral-purpose dc power circuit breakers covered by American National Standards. The solid-statedirect-acting overcurrent trip devices may include ground trip elements. These direct-actingtrip devices are sometimes referred to as "opening releases," especially in IEC (InternationalElectrotechnical Commission) Recommendations or "Specifications".</abstract>
