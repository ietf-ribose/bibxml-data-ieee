abstract:
  content: Many commercial software products and academic research projects continue
    to use analysis methods appropriate for transmission systems, but not for distribution
    systems. Many research papers submitted for publication still address questions
    that have been well-settled by previous work. The purpose of this Recommended
    Practice is to focus research attention on areas where legitimate needs exist,
    and to identify methods that should not be used in software products.
