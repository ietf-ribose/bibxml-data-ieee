    <abstract>Information that is useful in constructing an open-area test site used to perform radiated emission measurements in the frequency range of 30 MHz to 1000 MHz is provided. Final validity of the test site can only be made by performing site attenuation measurements as described in ANSI C63.4-2003.</abstract>
