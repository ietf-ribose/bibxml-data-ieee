abstract:
  content: Superseded by IEEE C37.90.1-2002. Design tests intended for protective
    relays and relay systems, including those incorporating digital processors, are
    specified. The tests are intended to be applied to a complete relay system under
    simulated operating conditions. Oscillatory and fast transient test-wave shapes
    and characteristics are defined. The equipment to be tested and the test conditions
    are described, and the points of application of the test wave are shown. Acceptance
    is defined, and the requisite test data are specified.
