    <abstract>The current methodologies, including apparatus, procedures, and measurement accuracies, for determining the dynamic characteristics of vibration dampers and damping systems are described. Some basic guidance is provided regarding a given methodÂ¿s strengths and weaknesses. The methodologies and procedures described are applicable to indoor testing only. Keywords: aeolian, decay method, forced response method, inverse standing wave ratio (ISWR) method, overhead conductors, power dissipation characteristics, power method, vibration dampers.</abstract>
