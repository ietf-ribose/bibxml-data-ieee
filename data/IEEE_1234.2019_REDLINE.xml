    <abstract>Test and measurements, which are performed on shielded power cables to identify the location of a fault, are described. Whenever possible, the limitations of a particular test and measurement to locate a fault are provided and recommendations are made regarding specialized fault-locating techniques. A fault characterization chart is included as an aid to select a fault-locating technique.</abstract>
