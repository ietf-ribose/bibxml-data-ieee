abstract:
  content: Extensions to the Virtual Station Interface (VSI) Discovery and Configuration
    Protocol (VDP) to support using the protocol between an end station and a device
    doing encapsulation/decapsulation for Network Virtualization Overlays Over Layer
    3 (NVO3) are specified in this amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018. The extensions
    include adding format types [e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) addresses] and enhancing
    indication of migration events.
