abstract:
  content: Describes the IEEE Std 855-1990, IEEE standard for microprocessor operating
    system interfaces (MOSI), which defines an interface between application programs
    and their operating environments. It is designed to be compatible with most operating
    systems in common use in microcomputer environments, within the scope of services
    that the various operating systems provide. It can be used to access the services
    of a variety of operating systems in both small-scale and large-scale environments.<<ETX>>
