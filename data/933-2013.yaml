abstract:
  content: Guidelines for the definition of a reliability program at nuclear generating
    stations andother nuclear facilities are provided. The document emphasizes reliability
    programs during theoperating phase of such stations; however, the general approach
    applies to all phases of thenuclear power generating station life cycle (e.g.,
    design, construction, start-up, operating, anddecommissioning).
