    <abstract>U.S. consensus standard methods, instrumentation, and facilities for measurement of radio-frequency (RF) emissions and signals emitted from wireless power transfer equipment in the frequency range from 9 kHz to 40 GHz are specified. This standard does not include generic nor product-specific emission limits. Where possible, the specifications herein are harmonized with other national and international standards used for similar purposes.</abstract>
