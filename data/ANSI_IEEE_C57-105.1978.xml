    <abstract>The characteristics of the various transformer connections and possible operating problems under normal or abnormal conditions are treated for three-phase distribution systems. These systems are characterized by primary voltages up to and including 34.5 kV, usually have a preponderance of connected transformers with low-voltage windings below 1000 V, and furnish electric service to consumers. All combinations of Delta and Y, grounded and ungrounded, T connected, zigzag, and certain special connections are considered. Only two-winding transformers are included. Phasing procedures and loading practices are not covered.</abstract>
