abstract:
  content: Utilizing terminology as established in IEEE Std 2755-2017, defined and
    classified in this guide are approximately 150 features and functions across five
    core areas of technology capability in the family of new technology products collectively
    referred to as Intelligent Process Automation. This guide is published to create
    clarity for individuals involved with Software-Based Intelligent Process Automation
    products so that industry participants may rely on a product manufacturerâ€™s functionality
    claims and understand the underlying technological methods used to produce those
    functions and how one might approach evaluating the relative sophistication and
    importance of each function or feature. This guide represents the consensus of
    a diverse panel of industry participants.
