    <abstract>Reaffirmed 2005 Diagnostic tests and measurements that are performed in the field on oil-immersed power transformers and regulators are described. Whenever possible, shunt reactors are treated in a similar manner to transformers. Tests are presented systematically in categories depending on the subsystem of the unit being examined. A diagnostic chart is included as an aid to identify the various subsystems. Additional information is provided regarding specialized test and measuring techniques.</abstract>
