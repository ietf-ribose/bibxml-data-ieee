    <abstract>This standard defines the protocol and compatible network equipment for optical wireless communications and its operation as an optical wireless personal area network (OWPAN) supporting data rates of multiple Gbit/s for wireless specialty applications. The standard defines a medium access control (MAC) layer operating in beacon-enabled or non-beacon-enabled mode and three physical layers (PHYs) enabling low complexity, low power, and high throughput.</abstract>
