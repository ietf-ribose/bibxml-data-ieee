    <abstract>This recommended practice is intended to identify, organize, and summarize information about ac high-voltage circuit breakers provided by the manufacturer that knowledgeable users will find useful for the receipt, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning of ac high-voltage circuit breakers above 1000 V. Recommended categories and an arrangement for the presentation of information in circuit breaker instruction manuals is covered in this recommended practice.</abstract>
