    <abstract>This standard provides specifications for a high-speed serial bus that supports both asynchronous and isochronous communication and integrates well with most IEEE standard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses. It is intended to provide a low-cost interconnect between cards on the same backplane, cards on other backplanes, and external peripherals. Interfaces to longer distance transmission media [such as unshielded twisted pair (UTP), optical fiber, and plastic optical fiber (POF)] allow the interconnection to be extended throughout a local network. This standard follows the command and status register (CSR) architecture of IEEE Std 1212trade-2001.</abstract>
