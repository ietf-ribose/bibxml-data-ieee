    <abstract>This standard provides multi-source and "plug and play" environment for the millions of metering devices in the field now and the future using the ANSI Type 2 optical port interface. It solves the problems associated with single source systems and with multi-source systems based upon proprietary communications protocols. Electric, water, and gas utilities and corresponding vendors can realize cost savings which ultimately shall benefit the client consumers of the utilities.</abstract>
