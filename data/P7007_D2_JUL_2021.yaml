abstract:
  content: This standard establishes a set of ontologies with different abstraction
    levels that contain concepts, definitions, axioms and use cases which assist in
    the development of ethically driven methodologies for the design of Robots and
    Automation Systems. It focuses on the Robotics and Automation domain, without
    considering any particular application or robot, and can be used in multiple ways,
    for instance, during the development of Robotics and Automation Systems as a guideline;
    or as a reference "taxonomy" to enable a clear and precise communication among
    members from different communities that include Robotics and Automation, Ethics,
    and correlated areas. Users of this standard need to have a minimal knowledge
    on formal Logics to understand the axiomatization expressed in Common Logic Interchange
    Format. Additional information can be found at https://standards.ieee.org/industry-connections/ec/autonomous-systems.html
