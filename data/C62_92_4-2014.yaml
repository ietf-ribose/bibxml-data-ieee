abstract:
  content: The neutral grounding of single- and three-phase ac electric-utility primary
    distribution systems with nominal voltages in the range of 2.4 kV 34.5 kV is addressed.
    Classes of distribution-systems grounding are defined. Basic considerations in
    distribution-system grounding concerning economics, control of temporary overvoltages,
    control of ground-fault currents, andground relaying are addressed. Also considered
    is the use of grounding transformers, grounding of high-voltage neutral of wye-delta
    distribution transformers, and interconnection of primary and secondary neutrals
    of distribution transformers.
