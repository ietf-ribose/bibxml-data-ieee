abstract:
  content: This IEEE standard provides uniform and acceptable terms for use in the
    application of solar cells to power systems. The terms are useful in unifying
    expressions used in engineering writing and in the preparation of specifications
    and procurement documents. It is expected that this standard will be most useful
    to persons not expert in the solar cell field.<<ETX>>
