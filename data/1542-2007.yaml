abstract:
- content: The guide is based on industry practices, and guidelines for installation,
    maintenance and operation of irrigation equipment near or under power lines as
    they pertain to minimum distance to energized conductors and proper grounding
    to minimize nuisance shocks are presented. A variety of conditions in general
    terms is covered in this guide. Specific recommendations are made for the type
    of irrigation systems and power line parameters most commonly found.
