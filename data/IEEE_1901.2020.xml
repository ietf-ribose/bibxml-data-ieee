    <abstract>Physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of a broadband powerline communication technology for local area networks (LANs), Smart Energy, Smart Grid, Internet of Things, transportation platforms (vehicle) applications, and other data distribution are defined in this standard. The balanced and efficient use of the power line communications channel by all classes of BPL devices is the main focus of this standard, defining detailed mechanisms for coexistence and interoperability between different BPL devices, and ensuring that desired bandwidth and quality of service may be delivered. The necessary security questions are addressed to ensure the privacy of communications between users and to allow the use of BPL for security sensitive services.</abstract>
