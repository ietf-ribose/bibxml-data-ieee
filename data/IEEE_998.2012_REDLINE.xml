    <abstract>Design information for the methods historically and typically applied by substation designers to reduce direct lightning strokes to equipment and buswork within substations is provided. Two approaches, the classical empirical method and the electrogeometric model, are presented in detail. A third approach, which involves the use of non-conventional lightning terminals and related design methods, is also reviewed.</abstract>
