    <abstract>This standard will write a standard practices guide for the measurement of radar cross section. This guide will discuss RCS measurement practices as they relate to indoor and outdoor measurement in an established range. It will not discuss measurement of foliage, natural events, etc. It will also not discuss near field measurement and other specialty measurements.</abstract>
