    <abstract>The calculation method for selection of phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase insulation withstand voltages for equipment is presented. This guide gives methods for insulation coordination of different air-insulated systems like transmission lines and substations. The methods of analysis are illustrated by practical examples.</abstract>
