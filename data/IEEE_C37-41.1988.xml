    <abstract>Superseded. Tests for high-voltage fuses (above 600 V), distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories (for AC distribution systems) are covered. These include enclosed, open, and open-link types of distribution cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses; distribution oil cutouts; distribution enclosed single-pole air switches; power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor and indoor fuse disconnecting switches; fuse supports, fuse mountings, fuse hooks, fuse tongs, and fuse links of the type used exclusively with the above products; and removable switch blades for certain of the above.</abstract>
