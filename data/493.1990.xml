    <abstract>The fundamentals of reliability analysis as it applies to the planning and design of industrial and commercial electric power distribution systems are presented. Included are basic concepts of reliability analysis by probability methods, fundamentals of power system reliability evaluation, economic evaluation of reliability, cost of power outage data, equipment reliability data, examples of reliability analysis. Emergency and standby power, electrical preventive maintenance, and evaluating and improving reliability of the existing plant are also addressed. The presentation is self-contained and should enable trade-off studies during the design of industrial and commercial power systems design, installation, and maintenance practices for electrical power and grounding (including both power-related and signal-related noise control) of sensitive electronic processing equipment used in commercial and industrial applications are presented.</abstract>
