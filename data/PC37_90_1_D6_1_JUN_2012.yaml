abstract:
  content: Two types of design tests for relays and relay systems that relate to the
    immunity of this equipment to repetitive electrical transients are specified.
    Test generator characteristics, test waveforms, selection of equipment terminals
    on which tests are to be conducted, test procedures, criteria for acceptance and
    documentation of test results are described. This standard has been harmonized
    with IEC standards where consensus could be reached.
