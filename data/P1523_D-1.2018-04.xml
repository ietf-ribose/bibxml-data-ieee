    <abstract>The various important aspects that need to be considered for satisfactory long-term performance of room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubber high-voltage insulator coatings (HVIC) are outlined in the guide. Methods of application, pre-coated applications, maintenance issues on coated applications, factors aff ecting long-term performance, erosion resistance, temporary loss of hydrophobicity, aging, laboratory accelerated tests, partially coated insulation, and functional outdoor evaluation are described.</abstract>
