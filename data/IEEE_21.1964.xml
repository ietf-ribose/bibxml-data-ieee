    <abstract>This standard covers the following: electrical requirements for outdoor power apparatus bushings having basic impulse insulation levels 110 through 1300 kilovolts. Mechanical requirements for the outdoor power apparatus bushings; dimensions of the outdoor power transformer and alternating-current power circuit breaker apparatus bushings. This standard does not apply to bushings for indoor apparatus, dry type instrument transformers, air-blast transformers, dry type regulators, oil-less and oil-poor apparatus, roof, floor, wall and generator bushings, potheads, distribution type circuit breakers and back-connected switch insulators. Bushing requirements as set forth in this standard apply to bushings when mounted for testing, according to requirements outlined in the paper.</abstract>
