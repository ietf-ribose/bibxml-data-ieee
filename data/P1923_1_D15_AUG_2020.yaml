abstract:
  content: A method for computation of an energy efficiency upper bound for an apparatus
    (wireless or wired) processing a particular communication signal waveform is specified
    in this standard. This method utilizes the signal envelope probability density
    function in combination with apparatusâ€™ power dissipation characteristics to calculate
    the energy efficiency upper bound. The purpose of this standard is to provide
    a consistent tool to other Working Groups and other practitioners who need to
    evaluate any communication signal waveforms potential for energy efficiency when
    implemented in hardware.
