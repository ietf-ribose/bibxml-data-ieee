    <abstract>This Guide lists the various field test methods that are currently available or underdevelopment with guidance on HOW to perform each test. The Guide covers shielded, insulatedpower cable systems rated 5 kV through 500 kV unless these voltages are modified by the specific "point" document.</abstract>
