    <abstract>The network-based coexistence information exchange among networks and devices to enable network-based coexistence management is defined in this amendment to IEEE 802.19.1-2014. This amendment specifies procedures and protocols for collection and exchange of coexistence information of heterogeneous networks, spectrum resource measurements and network performance metrics, such as packet error ratio, delay, etc., and information elements and data structures to capture coexistence information.
