abstract:
  content: The expanding use of digital communications among subsystems of the transportation
    infrastructure has spawned the development of data dictionaries for the communications
    between these subsystems. A format for intelligent transportation system (ITS)
    data dictionaries, including common terms (e.g. time, date, location), as well
    as the meta-attributes necessary to document ITS data concepts, is addressed in
    this standard.
