    <abstract>General types of LTC mechanisms, breathing configurations, and electrical designs are described for reference for determining methods of testing and evaluating dissolved gases in mineral based transformer oils in Load Tap Changers (LTCs) are discussed and recommended in this guide. Measurements of dissolved gas concentrations in the LTC oil are required to implement this Guide. This guide is not manufacturer specific, rather category specific.</abstract>
