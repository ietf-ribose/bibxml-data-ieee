    <abstract>This is a guide describing the surge voltage, surge current, and temporary overvoltages(TOV) environment in low-voltage [up to 1000 V root mean square (rms)] ac power circuits. This scope does not include other power disturbances, such as notches, sags, and noise. This IEEE standards product is part C62 Family on Surge Protection.</abstract>
