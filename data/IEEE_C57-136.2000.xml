    <abstract>Reaffirmed September 22, 2005. Guidelines are provided for the selection of suitable sound reduction methods in oil-immersed power transformers and shunt reactors over 500 kVA.Sound-producing sources within transformers and reactors are discussed.Sound abatement procedures are described for achieving various levels of sound reduction in transformer and shunt reactor installations.</abstract>
