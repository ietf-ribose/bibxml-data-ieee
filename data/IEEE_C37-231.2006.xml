    <abstract>This recommended practice deals with the implications surrounding the use and administration of firmware revisions for protection-related equipment. In general, the number of firmware revisions have become prolific since the introduction of microprocessor-based protection related equipment and no standard means of dealing with the issues surrounding this situation has been addressed. This recommended practice attempts to provide guidelines for the effective communication of firmware-related issues with the intent of helping to maximize the security and reliability of the power system.</abstract>
