    <abstract>A structure of low-altitude airspace for efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) traffic management is defined in this standard. The standard elaborates the structural low altitude based on UAV low-altitude public air routes from five parts: grid technology, remote sensing data, communication and networking, route planning, operation, and management.</abstract>
