    <abstract>Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets and headsets. The methods may also be applicable to a wide variety of other communications equipment, including cordless, wireless and mobile communications devices. Measurement results may be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized basis. Application is in the frequency range from 100 to 8,500 Hz.</abstract>
