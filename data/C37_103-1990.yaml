abstract:
  content: 'The following topics were dealt with: IEEE C37.103-1990, IEEE Guide for
    Differential and Polarizing Relay Circuit Testing, covers the testing and verification
    required to ensure correct connections for ground relay polarizing and differential
    relay connections. Relay calibration, setting, insulation, and instrument transformer
    tests are referred to in this guide and are assumed to be developed by the individual
    user. This guide is not intended to discuss these aspects in detail.<<ETX>>'
