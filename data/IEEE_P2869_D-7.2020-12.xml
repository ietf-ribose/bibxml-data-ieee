    <abstract>The synchronous monitoring method, the layout principle, and the analysis of monitoring results of direct current (dc) magnetic bias current distribution on transmission networks 110 kV and above from transformers (including converter transformers) are specified in this guide. This guide does not discuss the effect of dc or geomagnetically induced current (GIC) on transformers.</abstract>
