    <abstract>General guidelines for commissioning high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) converter stations and associated transmission systems are provided. These guidelines apply to HVDC systems utilizing 6-pulse or 12-pulse thyristor-valve converter units operated as a two-terminal HVDC transmission system or an HVDC back-to-back system.</abstract>
