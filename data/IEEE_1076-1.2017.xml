    <abstract>The IEEE 1076.1 language, a hardware description language for the description and the simulation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal systems, is defined in this standard. The language, also informally known as VHDL-AMS, is built on IEEE Std 1076-2008 (VHDL) and extends it with additions and changes to provide capabilities of writing and simulating analog and mixed-signal models. (Additional downloadable files are available for this standard at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/1076/1076.1-2017/).</abstract>
