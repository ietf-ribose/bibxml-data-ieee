    <abstract>A secure device identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device, and supports authentication of the deviceÂ¿s identity. Locally significant identities can be securely associated with an initial manufacturer-provisioned DevID and used in provisioning and authentication protocols to allow a network administrator to establish the trustworthiness of a device and select appropriate policies for transmission and reception of data and control protocols to and from the device.</abstract>
