    <abstract>This standard includes only the requirements for metal- clad and station-type cubicle switchgear. These requirements were previously a part of ANSI/IEEE C37.20-1969 (R 1981), IEEE Standard for Switchgear Assemblies including Metal-Enclosed Bus (1974 Consolidated Edition). Other types of equipment previously included in ANSI / IEEE C37.20-1969 (R 1981) will now be incorporated in separate publications.</abstract>
