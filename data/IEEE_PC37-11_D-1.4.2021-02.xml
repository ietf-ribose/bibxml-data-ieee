    <abstract>Standard requirements for all types of electrical control 37 circuits for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V are given. This standard is applicable for any type of power operated mechanism and for both ac and dc control power. Only basic control elements of the circuit breaker, including reclosing where required, are included in this standard. Devices or circuits for protective relaying, special interlocking, etc., are not included.</abstract>
