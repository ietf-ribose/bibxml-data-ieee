    <abstract>This standard specifies two data interchange formats for reporting and containing election results data exported from voting systems used for managing elections and tabulating election results. It allows for reporting on information known in advance about the election, for reporting election night results, and for reporting on updates and certified results from the post-election canvass. It can be used for reporting election results from distributed voting places to central offices of the county or state, and from county or state offices to news media and the general public. The electronic formats can also be used as a basic export of election information from an election management system (EMS) and for combining election data from different EMSs or transferring election data between EMSs. This standard includes a data model in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that itemizes and defines the data involved in election management and election results reporting, and specifies two concrete data formats that can be used to import and export data from voting systems: --XML (extensible markup language), and--JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</abstract>
