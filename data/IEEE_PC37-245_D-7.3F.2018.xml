    <abstract>Protection methods for different types of phase shifting transformers (PST) are provided in this guide, and the interaction between protection and operating conditions of PSTs is discussed. Models representing PSTs to determine short circuit currents for relaying functions are presented. Sizing and location issues of protection current transformers employed in the protection of PSTs are included. Examples of appropriate relay applications and settings are provided.</abstract>
