abstract:
  content: This goal of this standard is to define and classify the components and
    functionality of adaptive instructional systems (AISs) as it is applied to individual
    learners. A conceptual model of AISs for team, collective and collaborative instruction
    will be the subject of a future standard. This standard also defines parameters
    used to describe AISs and establishes requirements and guidance for the use and
    measurement of these parameters. The expected outcome of this standardization
    project is an AIS conceptual model that describes AIS features, processes, and
    events for individual learners.
