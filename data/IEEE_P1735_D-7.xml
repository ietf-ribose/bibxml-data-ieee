    <abstract>Distribution of electronic design intellectual property (EDIP) creates a risk of unsanctioned use and dilution of the investment in its creation. This standard provides guidance on technical protection measures to those who produce, use, process, or standardize the specifications of such electronics design descriptions. These measures include protection through encryption, specification, and management of use rights that have been granted by the producers of electronic designs and methods for integrating license verification for granted rights.</abstract>
