abstract:
  content: Recommendations to protect against harmful effects in human beings exposed
    to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz are provided
    in this standard. These recommendations are intended to apply in controlled environments
    and for general population exposure. These recommendations are not intended to
    apply to the exposure of patients by or under the direction of physicians and
    medical professionals.
