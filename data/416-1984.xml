    <abstract>This standard defines ATLAS, the Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems, which offers a standardized test language for expressing test specifications and test procedures. It is a test-oriented language independent of test equipment, and provides a standard abbreviated English language used in the preparation and documentation of test procedures that can be implemented either manually or with automatic and semi-automatic equipment. ATLAS was originally developed for avionics applications under the auspices of Aeronautical Radio, Inc (ARINC). As the language expanded into non-avionic applications, the original sponsors recommended the transfer of further ATLAS development to the IEEE.</abstract>
