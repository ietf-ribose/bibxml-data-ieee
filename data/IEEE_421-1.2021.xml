    <abstract>Defined in this standard are elements and commonly used components in excitation systems. Also contained are definitions for excitation systems applied to synchronous machines. An included annex contains one-line block diagrams of some typical excitation systems. These are presented to illustrate the defined terminology referenced in this standard and clarify the understanding of the excitation control system.</abstract>
