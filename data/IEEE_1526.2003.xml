    <abstract>This recommended practice presents tests to determine the performance of stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems and for verifying PV system design. These tests apply only to complete systems with a defined load. Performance testing is conducted outdoors under prevailing conditions over a period of about one month. These tests are intended to assist designers, manufacturers, system integrators, system users, and laboratories that will conduct the tests. System safety and component reliability issues are not addressed in this recommended practice.</abstract>
