abstract:
- content: A protocol is provided in this standard that enables precise synchronization
    of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such
    as network communication, local computing, and distributed objects. The protocol
    is applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems
    are enabled that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and
    stability to synchronize. System-wide synchronization accuracy and precision in
    the sub-microsecond range are supported with minimal network and local clock computing
    resources. Simple systems are installed and operated without requiring the management
    attention of users because the default behavior of the protocol allows for it.
