abstract:
- content: ANSI/IEEE Std 323-1984, IEEE Standard for Qualifying Class IE Equipment
    for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, was developed to provide qualification
    requirements for Class IE (safety-related) electrical equipments that would confirm
    the adequacy of such equipments to perform their safety functions on a continuing
    basis throughout their installed life. This document is based on ANSI/IEEE Std
    323-1983 and is intended to present specific qualification procedures for switchgear
    assemblies in Class IE application.

- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. Methods and requirements for qualifying switchgear assemblies
    for indoor areas outside of the containment area in nuclear power generating stations
    are described. These assemblies include metal-enclosed low-voltage power circuit
    breaker switchgear assemblies, metal-clad switchgear assemblies, and metal-enclosed
    interrupter switchgear assemblies. This standard amplifies the general requirements
    of ANSI/IEEE 323-1983, IEEE Standard for Qualifying Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear
    Power Generating Stations, as they apply to Class 1E switchgear assemblies. You
    will receive an email from Customer Service with the URL needed to access this
    publication online.
