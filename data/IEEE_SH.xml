    <abstract>Withdrawn March 2000. Terms that apply to linear, passive, reciprocal, time-invariant networks are defined. The terms apply to mathematical concepts that represent idealizations of physical phenomena. Thus, the definitions apply to idealized models that are useful in describing properties of physical networks. The question of whether or not a certain term is applicable to a particular physical situation is left to the user.</abstract>
