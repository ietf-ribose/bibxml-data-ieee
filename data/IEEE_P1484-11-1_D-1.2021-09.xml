    <abstract>This Standard describes a data model to support the interchange of data elements and their values between a content object and a runtime service (RTS). It is based on a current industry practice called “CMI—Computer Managed Instruction.” The work upon which this Standard is based was developed to support a client/server environment in which a learning technology system, generically called a learning management system (LMS), de-livers digital content, called content objects, to learners. The data model supports learner data and preferences, interactions, objectives, content-object entry, exit, and status information, time parameters, and scores.</abstract>
