    <abstract>Single-phase instrument transformers of a nominal system voltage of 115 kV and above with capacitive insulation system for line-to-ground connection and for both indoor and outdoor application is discussed in this standard. This standard is intended for use as a supplement to IEEE Std C57.13Â¿-2008 and as a basis for performance and safety of equipment. It also describes test sequences, criteria, methods, and documentation for the test.</abstract>
