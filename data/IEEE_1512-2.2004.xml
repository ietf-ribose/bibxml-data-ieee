    <abstract>This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about public safety issues involved in transportation-related events, through common incident management message sets. Message sets specified are consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1 or ASN) syntax. This standard comprises one companion standard of the family of incident management standards centered around a base standard, IEEE Std 1512-2000.</abstract>
