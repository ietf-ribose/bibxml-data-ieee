    <abstract>The detection and location of acoustic emissions (AEs) from partial discharges (PDs) and other sources in liquid-insulated power transformers and reactors are covered in this guide. A means of associating the relative magnitude and position of PDs and other sources with the acoustic signals obtained by strategically located transducers is provided.</abstract>
