    <abstract>A technical basis for implementation of electronic power subsystems is provided in this recommended practice. It is intended for electronic systems engineers and integrators, electronic power subsystem designers and integrators, as well as power element manufacturers and suppliers. It addresses system-level issues in element or subsystem integration, adaptation, and accommodation. It also defines system-level interface parameters, test methods, and test conditions. It provides for a systems engineering approach to acquisition, adaptation, and integration of electronic power subsystems, facilitates and promotes a modular approach to element or subsystem integration, and enables effective communication between the end users of power electronics and their manufacturers or suppliers.</abstract>
