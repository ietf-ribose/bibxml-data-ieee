abstract:
  content: An introductory review of the equivalent electric circuit of a piezoelectric
    vibrator and its parameters is followed by a discussion of the determination of
    these parameters by the transmission method. This method was published in 1951
    and became the basis for the 1957 IRE Standard. Since that time, a thorough investigation
    of the transmission method has resulted in more precise expressions which permit
    a more accurate evaluation of the parameters. This method is suitable for frequencies
    up to about 30 MHz for the commonly encounted ranges of the capacitance ratio
    r and the figure of merit M, provided that errors due to instrumentation are taken
    into account. The equations presented in this Standard have been formulated to
    correct these errors.<<ETX>>
