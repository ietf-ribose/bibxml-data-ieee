abstract:
  content: This standard is a guideline for establishing criteria for application,
    performance, interchangeability, tests, life cycle costs and safety requirements
    of traction power rectifier transformers. Electrical, mechanical and thermal design,
    manufacturing, and testing requirements are set forth for traction power rectifier
    transformers for DC electrification systems. This standard covers Liquid-immersed
    and Dry-type transformers, including those with cast coil and epoxy resin encapsulated
    windings
