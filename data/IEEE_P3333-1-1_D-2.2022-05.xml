    <abstract>As the demand and supply for 3D technologies growing, the development of accurate quality assessment techniques shall be used to develop the industries of the 3D display devices and signal processing engines. This standard describes underlying principles and statistical characteristics of 3D contents based on human visual system (HVS). In addition, the reliable 3D subjective assessment methodology which covers the characteristics of human perception, display mechanism, viewing environment is introduced in this document.</abstract>
