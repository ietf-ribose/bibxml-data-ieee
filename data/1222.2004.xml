    <abstract>SUMMARY: This standard covers construction, mechanical, electrical, and optical performance, installation guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements, environmental considerations, and accessories for an all-dielectric, non-metallic, self-supporting fiber optic (ADSS) cable. The ADSS cable is designed to be located primarily on overhead utility facilities. This standard provides both construction and performance requirements that insure within the guidelines of the standard that the dielectric capabilities of the cable components and maintenance of optical fiber integrity and optical transmissions are proper.</abstract>
