abstract:
  content: IEEE Std. 1680.1 provides a clear and consistent set of performance criteria
    for the design of personal computer products including notebook computers, desktop
    computers, and computer displays thereby providing an opportunity to secure market
    recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of electronic products.
    This standard is intended to provide a tool for government, institutional and
    corporate purchasers. Product manufacturers may also use this tool to earn recognition
    in the consumer market, recognizing that certain criteria may not be applicable
    to all types of purchasers. There are three levels of conformance with this Standard.
    To achieve the first level, the product shall conform to all of the 23 required
    environmental criteria. To achieve the second level, the product shall conform
    to all of the required criteria plus at least 50% of the 28 optional criteria,
    and to achieve the third level the product shall conform to all the required criteria
    and at least 75% of the optional criteria. This Standard shall be updated and
    revised on a periodic basis to continue to set a higher performance standard for
    leadership products.
