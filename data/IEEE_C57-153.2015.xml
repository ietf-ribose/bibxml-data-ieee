    <abstract>Control methods of paralleling regulating transformers are described and compared in this guide. The control methods include: master/follower, circulating current, power factor,circulating reactive current and negative reactance methods. Operating philosophy descriptions, sample wiring diagrams, typical operational variations, the provision of adequate backup protection, and typical misapplication consequences are presented. This guide does not apply to phase-shifting regulating transformers.</abstract>
