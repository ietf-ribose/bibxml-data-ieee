    <abstract>This standard defines a data model for describing, referencing, and sharing competency definitions and frameworks of competency definitions, in the context of online and distributed learning and in employment and work. This standard provides a way to formally represent the key characteristics of a competency definition, independently of its use in any particular context. It enables interoperability among learning systems that deal with competency information by providing a means for them to refer to common definitions with common meanings.</abstract>
