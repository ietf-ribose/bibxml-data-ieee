    <abstract>A simplified method of calculating the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead lines, given the weather conditions, is presented. Along with a mathematical method, sources of the values to be used in the calculation are indicated. This standard does not undertake to list actual temperature-ampacity relationships for a large number of conductors in a large number of conditions.</abstract>
