abstract:
  content: Amend the guide to add guidelines for producing reusable TSFs for use on
    platforms utilizing ATML, and produce example TSFs showing conformance with the
    guidelines. This guide explains how signal definitions and test requirements may
    be implemented in conformance with IEEE Std 1641-2010. It also provides background
    information, tutorial support, and examples of signal definitions and test requirements
    for users of the standard. TSFs are major component for adhering with the IEEE
    Std 1641. There is little guidance in helping users create their own reusable
    TSFs or examples that show good practices to copy.
