abstract:
  content: The guide describes the most common sheath-bonding systems now in use and
    the methods of calculating sheath voltages and currents, particularly as applied
    to three-phase systems operating at 60 kV and above, with the neutral grounded
    directly or through an impedance. The user is cautioned to make sure that a design
    does not contravene any local or national regulations.<<ETX>>
