    <abstract>An access network (which connects terminals to their access routers) utilizing technologies based on the family of IEEE 802(R) standards is specified in this recommended practice. An access network reference model (NRM) that includes entities and reference points along with behavioral and functional descriptions of communications among those entities is provided in this recommended practice.
