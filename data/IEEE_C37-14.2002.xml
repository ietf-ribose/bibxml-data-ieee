    <abstract>Reaffirmed 2008. Revision of IEEE Std C37.14-1999. This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations and Protective Relays. Abstract:This standard covers enclosed low-voltage dc power circuit breakers of the stationary or draw-out type of one- or two-pole construction with one or more rated maximum voltages of 300 V, 325 V, 800 V, 1000 V, 1200 V, 1600 V, or 3200 V for applications on dc systems having nominal voltages of 250 V, 275 V, 750 V, 850 V, 1000 V, 1500 V, or 3000 V, with general-purpose, high-speed, semi-high-speed and rectifier circuit breakers; manually or power-operated; and with or without electromechanical or electronic trip devices. It deals with service conditions, ratings, functional components, temperature limitations and classification of insulating materials, dielectric withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application.</abstract>
