abstract:
  content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    medical device communication, an abstract, object-oriented domain information
    model that specifies the structure of exchanged information, as well as the events
    and services that are supported by each type of object, is provided in this standard.
    All data structure elements are specified using abstract syntax (ASN.1) and may
    be applied to many different implementation technologies, transfer syntaxes, and
    application service models. Core subjects include medical, alert, system, patient,
    control, archival, communication, and extended services. Model extensibility is
    supported, and a conformance model and statement template is provided.
