    <abstract>Superseded Uniform minimum acceptable requirements for the preparation and content of Software Quality Assurance Plans (SQAPs) are provided. The standard also provides a standard against which such plans can be compared and assessed. It applies to the development and maintenance of critical software. For noncritical software, or for software already developed, a subset of the requirements of this standard may be applied.</abstract>
