    <abstract>This standard defines data formats to facilitate communications between Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems and smart RFID tags with integral transducers (sensors and actuators). The standard defines new Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) formats based on the IEEE 1451 family of standards. This standard also defines a command structure and specifies the communication methods with which the command structure is designed to be compatible.</abstract>
