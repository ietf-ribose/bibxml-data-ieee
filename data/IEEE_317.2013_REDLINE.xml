    <abstract>An electric penetration assembly is an assembly of insulated electric conductors, conductor seals, module seals (if any), and aperture seals that provides the passage of the electric conductors through a single aperture in the nuclear containment structure, while providing a pressure barrier between the inside and the outside of the containment structure. The electric penetration assembly includes terminal (junction) boxes, terminal blocks, connectors and cable supports, and splices which are designed and furnished as an integral part of the assembly. Requirements for the design, construction, qualification, test, and installation of electric penetration assemblies in nuclear containment structures for stationary nuclear power generating stations are prescribed in this standard.</abstract>
