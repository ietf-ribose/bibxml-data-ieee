abstract:
  content: The Waveform and Vector Exchange Specification (WAVES) is an application
    of the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). This standard covers the dataset
    structure, header file, WAVES files, external files, execution model, and waveform
    semantics, and defines three standard packages to support WAVES datasets.
