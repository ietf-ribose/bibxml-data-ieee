    <abstract>The standard provides criteria for the performance of periodic surveillance testing of nuclear power generating station safety systems. The scope of periodic surveillance testing consists of functional tests and checks, calibration verification, and time response measurements, as required, to verify that the safety system performs its defined safety function. Post maintenance and post-modification testing are is not covered by this document. This standard amplifies the periodic surveillance testing requirements of other nuclear safety-related IEEE standards.</abstract>
