abstract:
  content: This amendment to IEEE Std 1900.6-2011 adds procedures, protocols, and
    message format specifications for the exchange of sensing related data, control
    data, and configuration data between spectrum sensors and spectrum databases.
    In addition, it adds specifications for the exchange of sensing related data between
    the data archive and spectrum databases, and the cognitive engine and spectrum
    databases.
