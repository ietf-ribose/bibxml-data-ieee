abstract:
- content: Test methods and test articles for the evaluation of the image quality
    of CT security screening systems are provided. The quality of data for automated
    analysis is the primary concern. This standard does not address the system's ability
    to use its image data to automatically detect explosives or other threat materials,
    which is typically verified by an appropriate regulatory body.
