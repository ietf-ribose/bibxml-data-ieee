    <abstract>General technical recommended practice for operation of pulverized coal-fired boilers in power plants is provided, including start-up, shutdown, operation and maintenance, and emergency and failure detection/handling/prevention. In this document, a boiler with existing single units with a capacity of 300 MW to 600 MW in thermal power plants, where pulverized coal is combusted to generate electricity and/or to supply heat, is discussed. Development of boiler operation code as a reference to determine detailed operation steps and/or procedures for a particular boiler in the plant is outlined. The specifications of manufacturers, successful experiences from practice, and stipulations defined in other related high-level standards/regulations/codes are also considered.</abstract>
