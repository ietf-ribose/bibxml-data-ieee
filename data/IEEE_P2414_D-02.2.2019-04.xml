    <abstract>This standard would fulfill the lack of uniformity by defining all terms involved in jitter definition, by identifying all jitter components and by modelling them. In this standard a new definition and modelling framework is presented with the aim to be coherent as much as possible with existent standards. In particular, models and definition are given for jitter, timing jitter, timing error, time interval error, period jitter, cycle-to-cycle jitter, random jitter, wander, deterministic jitter, data-dependent jitter, periodic jitter, bounded uncorrelated jitter, DJ model total jitter, RMS and peak-to-peak jitter; bit-error rate, phase noise.</abstract>
