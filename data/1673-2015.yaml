abstract:
  content: Provided in this document are specific requirements for field installed
    sealing between a pressurized system (stream) containing flammable or combustible
    process fluids which is connected directly or indirectly to an electrical system
    where a failure could allow the migration of processfluids directly into the electrical
    system. Not addressed in this document are the basic requirements for electrical
    safety and the effects of the loss of containment of the process system in terms
    of risk to the environment and/or personnel health and safety.
