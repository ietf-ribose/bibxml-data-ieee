    <abstract>A set of useful quality considerations that can be selected and applied during one or more steps in a software acquisition process is described in this recommended practice. The recommended practices can be applied to software that runs on any computer system regardless of the size, complexity, or criticality of the software. The software supply chain may include integration of off-the-shelf (OTS), custom, or free and open source software (FOSS). Each organization or individual using this recommended practice will need to identify the specific quality and activities that need to be included within its acquisition process.</abstract>
