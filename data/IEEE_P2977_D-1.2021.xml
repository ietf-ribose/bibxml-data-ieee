    <abstract>This standard adopts MIPI Alliance--MIPI A-PHY Specification Version 1.0 as an IEEE Standard. The adopted standard provides an asymmetric data link in a point-to-point or daisy-chain topology, with high-speed unidirectional data, embedded bidirectional control data and optional power delivery over a single cable. In this way, it reduces wiring, cost and weight, as high-speed data, control data and optional power share the same physical wiring. For integration with existing network backbones, it complements Ethernet, Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, and other interfaces.</abstract>
