    <abstract>Amendment 1 addresses an observation made by a user of the standard. The observation raised a concern that misunderstandings may occur due to the common use of “tn” for otherre calculations. To address the concern, “tn” was changed to “p”. The value for the number of trials used in the standard remains the same.</abstract>
