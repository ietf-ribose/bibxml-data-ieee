abstract:
  content: This specification defines the requirements for a two-degree-of-freedom
    dynamically tuned gyro to be used as a sensor in a strapdown, gimballed inertial
    navigation system (attitude reference units) for use in an aircraft, a missile,
    a spacecraft or similar applications. The characteristics of the external capture
    electronics are considered where necessary to define gyro performance.<<ETX>>
