abstract:
  content: Recommendations and requirements for the design and applications of power
    electronics in land-based (onshore) and marine (offshore) electrical power systems
    are provided in this standard. A wide range of power electronics equipment with
    aggregated power ratings at and above 100 kW with voltages equal or less than
    52 kV (ac) or (dc) is covered. Existing engineering practices, analytical methods,
    and performance characteristics are described. Applicable international and local
    standards are referenced with appropriate guidance to provide users of the standard
    with correct criteria for design, testing, and maintenance necessary for reliable
    operation of integrated power systems.
