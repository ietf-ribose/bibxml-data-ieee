    <abstract>Superseded. Information on the equipment needed and the methods that can be used to clean contaminated electrical insulators are presented. The intent is to document the state of the art for cleaning insulators (excluding nuclear contaminants) of all types. Energized and de-energized systems are considered. The standard does not prescribe specific procedures, but rather reflects the experience of many individuals who have safely cleaned contaminated insulators.</abstract>
