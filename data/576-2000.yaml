abstract:
  content: A guide for installing, splicing, terminating, and field proof testing
    of cable systems in industrial and commercial applications is provided. It is
    not intended to be a design document,although many of the problems of installation
    can be avoided by designing cable layouts within the installation limits of this
    recommended practice.
