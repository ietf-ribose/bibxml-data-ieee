abstract:
  content: This amendment specifies IEEE Std 802.16 medium access control (MAC) enhancements
    and minimal orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) physical layer
    (PHY) modifications in licensed bands to support lower power consumption at the
    device, support by the base station of significantly larger numbers of devices,
    efficient support for small burst transmissions, and improved device authentication.
