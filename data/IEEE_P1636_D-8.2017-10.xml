    <abstract>Promoting and facilitating interoperability between components of automatic test systems where test results and/or maintenance actions need to be shared is addressed in this standard. The standard defines the common elements between both test results data and maintenance action data. The common schema becomes a class of information that shall be used within the SIMICA family of standards.</abstract>
