abstract:
- content: This recommended practice develops an XML application defining a standard
    language for symbolic music representation. The language is a meta-representation
    of music information for describing and processing said music information within
    a multi-layered environment, for achieving integration among structural, score,
    Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), and digital sound levels of representation.
    Furthermore, the recommended practice integrates music representation with already
    defined and accepted common standards. This recommended practice will be accepted
    by any kind of software dealing with music information, e.g., score editing, optical
    music recognition (OMR) systems, music performance, musical databases, and composition
    and musicological applications.
