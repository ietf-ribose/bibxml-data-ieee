    <abstract>Alternative approaches and good practices for the design, operation, and integration of distributed resource (DR) island systems with electric power systems (EPS) are provided. This includes the ability to separate from and reconnect to part of the area EPS while providing power to the islanded EPSs. This guide includes the DRs, interconnection systems, and participating EPSs.</abstract>
