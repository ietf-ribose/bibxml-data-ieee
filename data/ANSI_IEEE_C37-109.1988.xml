    <abstract>This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations and Protective Relays. This standard discusses the protection of shunt reactors used typically to compensate for capacitive shunt reactance of transmission lines. The more common circuit arrangements and protective relaying schemes presently in use are discussed and illustrated.</abstract>
