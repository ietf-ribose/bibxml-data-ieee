    <abstract>Requirements for power line carrier (PLC) transmitter/receiver equipment used to transfer discrete teleprotection signals at power line carrier frequencies (30-500 kHz) are described in this standard. Test requirements and conditions for determining performance, as well as manufacturing requirements, are defined.</abstract>
