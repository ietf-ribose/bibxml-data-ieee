    <abstract>This document provides guidelines for smart grid interoperability. This guide provides a knowledge base addressing terminology, characteristics, functional performance and evaluation criteria, and the application of engineering principles for smart grid interoperability of the electric power system with end use applications and loads. The guide discusses alternate approaches to good practices for the smart grid.</abstract>
