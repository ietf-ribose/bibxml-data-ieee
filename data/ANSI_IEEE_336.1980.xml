    <abstract>This standard sets forth the minimum requirements for installation, inspection and testing of Class 1E power, instrumentation and control equipment and systems during the construction phase of a nuclear power generating station. These requirements also cover modifications and those activities occurring during the operating phase that are comparable in nature and extent to related activities occurring during the initial construction of the station. All references to construction activities in this standard shall refer to this scope which includes operational modifications.</abstract>
