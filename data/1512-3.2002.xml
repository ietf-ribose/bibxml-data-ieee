    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE Std 1512.3-2006 This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about hazardous material and other cargo and contents of vehicles and buildings involved in transportation-related events, through common incident management message sets. That data exchange is specifically to support real-time interagency transportation-related incident management. Message sets specified are consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) syntax. This standard comprises one companion volume of the family of incident management standards centered around a base standard:IEEE Std 1512-2000, IEEE Standard for Common Incident Management Message Sets for Use by Emergency Management Centers. Other members of that family that are forthcoming include two other companion volumes, specifying incident management message sets for transportation management and public safety. Collectively, this family of standards shall be referred to as the IEEE 1512 Family of Standards. The goal of these standards is to support efficient communication for the real-time, interagency management of transportation-related events. Those events include incidents, emergencies, accidents, planned roadway closures, special events, and disasters caused by humans or natural events. These events include any such event that impacts transportation systems, or that causes a report to be received by an emergency management system, whether or not the event actually affects a transportation system, and whether or not a response is required.</abstract>
