    <abstract>A standard procedure for 1 naming time sequence data (TSD) files, such as files produced by digital fault recorders, power swing recorders, power quality monitors, and so on is specified. The sources of TSD files are described, and a survey of current naming techniques is provided. The advantages of using a common naming procedure are highlighted, and the limitations and applications are identified. Issues of compatibility across operating systems and various vintages, and adaptability to other types of files are also discussed. The required and optional portions of the naming procedure are described in detail, and many examples areprovided.</abstract>
