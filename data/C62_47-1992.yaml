abstract:
  content: This guide describes the electromagnetic threat posed to electronic equipment
    and subassemblies by actual electrostatic discharge (ESD) events from humans and
    mobile furnishings. This guide organizes existing data on the subject of ESD in
    order to charaterize the ESD surge environment. This guide is not an ESD test
    standard. It is intended to be a resource for equipment designers, and for preparers
    and users of ESD test standards. The manufacturing, handling, packaging, and transportation
    of individual electronic components, including integrated circuits, are not discussed,
    and this guide does not deal with mobile items such as automobiles, aircraft,
    and other masses of comparable size.
