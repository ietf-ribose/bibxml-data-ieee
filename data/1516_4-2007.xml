    <abstract>This recommended practice defines the processes and procedures that should be followed to implement Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) for federations being developed using the High Level Architecture (HLA) Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP). This recommended practice is not intended to replace existing VV&amp;A policies, procedures and guidance, but rather is intended to focus on the unique aspects of VV&amp;A of federations. It is a higher-level framework into which such practices can be integrated and tailored for specific uses. The VV&amp;A Overlay provides implementation-level guidance to VV&amp;A practitioners.</abstract>
