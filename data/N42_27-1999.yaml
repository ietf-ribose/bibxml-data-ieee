abstract:
  content: Minimum informational requirements for a Test and Measurement Report for
    flood sources used with scintillation cameras are provided. It is not intended
    to specify the means by which such information is obtained although it does place
    requirements and limitations on the methodology. In addition, it is not intended
    to cover the use of the source in the determination of the operating characteristics
    or correction factors for a scintillation camera.
