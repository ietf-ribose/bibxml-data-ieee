abstract:
  content: This standard provides a basis for showing the general physical location
    and arrangement of the sections of the required wiring system, and identifying
    the physical requirements for various types of materials needed to provide the
    electrical installation in buildings. The required installation is shown on the
    drawing by the use of the various applicable outlet and equipment symbols, together
    with interconnecting circuit or feeder run lines, supplemented with necessary
    notations. In general, basic symbols have been included in the symbol schedule.
    In some instances, the use of numbers or letters of the alphabet drawn, or at
    the side of, the basic symbol to identify a specific application of the symbol
    for a particular type of use of outlet may be required. In some instances, the
    physical or electrical size of the item identified by the symbol is noted to one
    side of it.<<ETX>>
