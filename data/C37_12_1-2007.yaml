abstract:
  content: This Guide provides a recommended table of contents for high-voltage circuit
    breaker instruction manuals. The Guide provides a listing of information that
    will help a knowledgeable user receive, install, commission, operate, and maintain
    circuit breakers. Recommended additional material is described in clause 5 for
    circuit breakers that are intended for high-voltage, free-standing installations.
    Drawout circuit breakers used in switchgear are excluded from Clause 5 requirements.
    Circuit breakers used in Gas Insulated Switchgear installations are excluded from
    this guide. This Guide in no way replaces the manufacturerâ€™s instruction manual
    which is to be used for safe and effective utilization of the circuit breaker.
    This Guide helps organize instruction manual information in a consistent and user
    friendly manner.
