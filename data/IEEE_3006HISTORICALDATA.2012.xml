    <abstract>Reliability data gathered from equipment reliability surveys and analyses over a period of 35 years or more is summarized in this collection. Equipment surveys conducted prior to 1976, detailed reports on the surveys and data collection efforts, and extensive lists of references on equipment reliability are presented. The collection provides the analyst with options for determining reliability parameters for older electrical systems.</abstract>
