    <abstract>Pulse transformers for use in electronic equipment are considered. This standard applies to the following transformer types: power output (drivers), impedance matching, interstage coupling, current sensing, and blocking-oscillator transformers. For these transformers, the peak power transmitted ranges from a few milliwatts to many kilowatts, and the peak voltage transmitted ranges from a few volts to many kilovolts. Symbols, performance tests, equivalent circuits, preferred test methods, marking, and service conditions are covered.</abstract>
