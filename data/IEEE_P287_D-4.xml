    <abstract>Coaxial Connectors for precision electrical measurements to 110 GHz. The frequency range of the standard is increased from 65 GHz to 110 GHz since there exists in the market a 1mm coaxial connector with a rated upper minimum operating frequency of 110 GHz. The members of the subcommittee felt in view of this, the scope of the project should be changed to incorporate this advantage.</abstract>
