abstract:
  content: The telephone network interface to a telemetry interface unit operating
    under the utility telemetry service architecture is described. The interface is
    described in terms of a utility meter reading application, but any enhanced service
    provider communication can be transported. Telemetry calls may be initiated by
    either the utility/enhanced service provider (outbound) or the telemetry interface
    unit/customer premise equipment (inbound) on the end user's premise.
