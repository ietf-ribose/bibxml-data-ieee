    <abstract>This document provides guidelines for temporary protective grounding (TPG) of electric power lines to protect workers from voltages and currents that might develop at a de-energized worksite during maintenance of AC overhead and underground, transmission and distribution lines, cables and equipment. Other forms of worker protection include isolation and insulation. These methods are described in other documents and guides and are not discussed here.</abstract>
