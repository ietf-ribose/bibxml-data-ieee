    <abstract>Guidelines are provided for Temporary Protective Grounding (TPG) of electric power lines to assist in protection of workers from voltages and currents that might develop at a de-energized worksite during maintenance of ac overhead and underground, transmission and distribution lines, cables, and equipment. Other forms of worker protection include isolation and insulation. These methods are described in other documents and guides and are not discussed here.</abstract>
