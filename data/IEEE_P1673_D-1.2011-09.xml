    <abstract>To develop design, evaluation and installation requirements for conduit and cable seals used in the field connected power, control and instrumentation wiring systems to equipment in the petroleum and chemical industry exposed to pressures above atmospheric (1.5 kilopascals , 0.22 psi) and at above or below ambient temperatures. This standard does not cover seals provided by manufacturers as part of listed equipment.</abstract>
