    <abstract>implementation independent specification for a software interface to information systems containing data pertinent to the diagnosis and maintenance of complex systems consisting of hardware, software, or any combination thereof. These interfaces will support service definitions for creating application programming interfaces (API) for the access, exchange, and analysis of historical diagnostic and maintenance information. The standard will use the information models of IEEE Std 1232-2002 - Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to All Test Environments (AI-ESTATE) as a foundation.</abstract>
