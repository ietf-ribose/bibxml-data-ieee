    <abstract>This standard covers means of safeguarding personnel while operating equipment located in electrolytic cell line working zones. Included are related requirements for equipment and electrical conductor installations. The general types of DC electrolytic cells covered include, but are not limited to, the cells used in the production of aluminum, cadmium, chlorate, chlorine, copper, fluorine, hydrogen peroxide, magnesium, sodium, and zinc. This standard does not cover: electroplating and anodizing facilities; AC cells or furnaces; electrothermal process furnaces; arc furnaces; melting or heat treating facilities; Any electrical equipment that is neither part of the electrolytic process equipment nor installed or used in the cell line working zone Items referred to in are not covered by this standard and shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 70-1975, National Electrical Code (ANSI C1-1975), or the latest revision thereof.</abstract>
