abstract:
  content: This standard applies to low-voltage gas discharge tube (GDT ) surge-protective
    components for application on systems with voltages less than or equal to 1000
    V rms or 1500 V dc. These protective components are designed to limit voltage
    surges on balanced or unbalanced communication circuits and on power circuits
    operating from dc to 420 Hz. This standard contains a series of standard test
    criteria for determining the electrical characteristics and ratings of gas discharge
    tube surge-protective components.
