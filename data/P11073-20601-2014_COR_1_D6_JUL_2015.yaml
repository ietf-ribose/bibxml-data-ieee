abstract:
  content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard defines a common framework for making an abstract
    model of personal health data available in transport-independent transfer syntax
    required to establish logical connections between systems and to provide presentation
    capabilities and services needed to perform communication tasks. The protocol
    is optimized to personal health usage requirements and leverages commonly used
    methods and tools wherever possible.This standard removes the ambiguities and
    corrects the wrong nomenclature codes and qualifier status that have been identified
    in the IEEE Std 11073-20601-2014 to make it easier to implement the standard in
    an interoperable fashion.
