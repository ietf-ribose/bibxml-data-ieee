    <abstract>" The media access control characteristics for the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision De-tection (CSMA/CD) access method for shared medium local area networks are described. The control charac-teristics for full duplex dedicated channel use are also described. Specifications are provided for MAU types1BASE5 at 1 Mb/s; Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) and MAU types 10BASE5, 10BASE2, FOIRL (fiber opticinter-repeater link), 10BROAD36, 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL, 10BASE-FB, and 10BASE-FP at 10 Mb/s; MediaIndependent Interface (MII) and PHY types 100BASE-T4, 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, and 100BASE-T2 at100 Mb/s; and the Gigabit MII (GMII) and 1000BASE-X PHY types, 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, and1000BASE-CX, which operate at 1000 Mb/s (Gigabit Ethernet) as well as PHY type 1000BASE-T. Repeaterspecifications are provided at each speed. Full duplex specifications are provided at the Physical Layer for10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL, 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, 100BASE-T2, and Gigabit Ethernet. System consider-ations for multisegment networks at each speed and management information base (MIB) specifications andadditions to support Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks (VLANs) as specified in IEEE P802.1Q (R) are also pro-vided. Also specified is an optional Link Aggregation sublayer which multiple physical links to be aggregatedtogethere to form a single logical link. "</abstract>
