    <abstract>The protection of shunt power capacitor and filter banks are covered. Guidelines forreliable applications of protection methods intended for use in many shunt capacitor applicationsand designs are included. The protection of pole-mounted capacitor banks on distribution circuitsand the application of capacitors connected directly to routing apparatus are not included.</abstract>
