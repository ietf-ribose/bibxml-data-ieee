abstract:
  content: The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide a small wind energy
    conversion system (SWECS) user, owner, or installer with interface guidelines
    and operating procedures necessary to connect and operate a SWECS in parallel
    with an electric utility system. It contains application guidelines and procedures
    for the interconnection and compatible operation of a SWECS with electric utilities.
    It addresses the interface between the wind system and the utility and the factors
    relating to equipment protection, power quality, and the safety of operating personnel
    and the general public.<<ETX>>
