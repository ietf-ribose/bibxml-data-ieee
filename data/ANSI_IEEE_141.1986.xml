    <abstract>A thorough analysis of basic electrical-systems considerations is presented. Guidance is provided in design, construction, and continuity of an overall system to achieve safety of life and preservation of property; reliability; simplicity of operation; voltage regulation in the utilization of equipment within the tolerance limits under all load conditions; care and maintenance; and flexibility to permit development and expansion. Recommendations are made regarding system planning; voltage considerations; surge voltage protection; system protective devices; fault calculations; grounding; power switching, transformation, and motor-control apparatus; instruments and meters; cable systems; busways; electrical energy conservation; and cost estimation.</abstract>
