    <abstract>Required procedures for performing design tests for high-voltage distribution class and power class fuses, as well as for fuse-disconnecting switches and enclosed single-pole air switches, are specified. These design tests, as appropriate to a particular device, include the following test types: dielectric, interrupting, load-break, radio-influence, short-time current, temperature rise, time-current, manual operation, thermal-cycle, bolt torque, and liquid tightness.</abstract>
