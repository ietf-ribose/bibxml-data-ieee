    <abstract>This standard is a guideline for establishing criteria for Application performance, interchangeability, Tests, Life cycle costs and safety requirements of traction power recitifier transformers, Electrical, mechanical and thermal design, manufacturing, and testing requirements are set forth for traction power rectifier transformers for DC electrification systems. This standard covers Liquid-immersed and Dry-type transformers, including those with Cast coil and Epoxy resin Encapsulated Windings.</abstract>
