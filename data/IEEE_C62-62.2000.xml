    <abstract>" This standard establishes methods for testing and measuring the performance charac-teristics for surge-protective devices used in low-voltage ac power circuits. Definitions are statedthat apply specifically to surge-protective devices. The testing requirements are categorized intotwo groups, in which a minimum set of basic tests (BTs) are prescribed for all surge-protectivedevices within the scope of its documents, supplemented by additional tests (ATs) that might beneeded to establish particular application requirements.
