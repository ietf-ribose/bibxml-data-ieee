    <abstract>The design requirements for a fiber-optic serial interconnect protocol, topology, and media is established. The application target for this standard is the interconnection of multiple aerospace sensors, processing resources, bulk storage resources, and communications resources onboard aerospace platforms. This standard is for subsystem interconnection, as opposed to intra-backplane connection.</abstract>
