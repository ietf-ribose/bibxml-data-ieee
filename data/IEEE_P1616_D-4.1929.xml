    <abstract>Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorders (MVEDRs) collect, record, store and export data related to motor vehicle pre-defined events in usage history. This standard defines a protocol for MVEDR output data compatibility and export protocols of MVEDR data elements. This standard defines a Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorder Connector Lockout Apparatus (MVEDRCLA) and a Near Field Communication (NFC) protocol of safeguarding access to a vehicle's event data recorder (EDR) data by securing the vehicle output diagnostic a link connector (DLC) and establishing a chain of custody link. This standard is without prejudice to requirements of national or regional laws related to privacy, data protection and personal data processing.</abstract>
