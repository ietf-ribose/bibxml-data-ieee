abstract:
  content: The existing low-energy critical infrastructure monitoring (LECIM) frequency
    shift keying (FSK) physical layer of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015 is extended to be
    more robust in presence of interference and achieve higher link budgets for applications
    in low power wide area networks (LPWAN). Lower symbol rates and a split mode with
    low rate forward error correction (FEC) codes are introduced to achieve this goal.
