    <abstract>In this period of transition, authors and editors of scientific and engineering literature sometimes need basic information on the International System of Units (the Metric System), described in this standard. This contains the units, supplementary units, and multiplier prefixes of the International System, along with instructions for their correct use. Numerous examples are given. Conversions between the International and the British-American System are also discussed, and a procedure is described for rounding after such conversions. Three appendixes define the International System base units, list conversion factors, and explain the work of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.</abstract>
