    <abstract>A common framework for extending the system and software life cycle processes of IEEE Std 12207-2008 to include the systematic practice of reuse is provided. This standard specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to be applied during each phase of the life cycle to enable a system and/or product to be constructed from reusable assets. It also specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to enable the identification, construction, maintenance, and management of assets supplied.</abstract>
