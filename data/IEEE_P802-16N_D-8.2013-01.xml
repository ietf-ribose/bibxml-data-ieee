    <abstract>Amendment to IEEE 802.16. This amendment specifies protocol enhancements to the medium access control layer (MAC) for enabling increased robustness and alternate radio path establishment in degraded network conditions. Limited orthogonal frequency-division multiple access physical layer (OFDMA PHY) extensions are included for enabling operation with radio path redundancy and direct communication between subscriber stations. Also mobile base stations and mobile relay stations are supported.</abstract>
