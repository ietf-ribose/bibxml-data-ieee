    <abstract>Instructions for conducting generally applicable and accepted tests to determine the performance characteristics of synchronous machines are contained in this guide. Although the tests described are applicable in general to synchronous generators, synchronous motors (larger than fractional horsepower), synchronous condensers, and synchronous frequency changers, the descriptions make reference primarily to synchronous generators and synchronous motors.</abstract>
