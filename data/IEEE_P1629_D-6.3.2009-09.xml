    <abstract>This standard defines the general characteristics of pantographs that enable current collection from an overhead contact system on light rail transit and heavy rail transit systems. The standard contains definitions pertinent to pantographs, including general definitions, specific pantograph terminology, and pantograph components, pantograph dimensions, and operating characteristics. The operating requirements that need to be defined by the purchaser of pantographs are stated. In addition, standard dimensions for the collector head and contact strip, various pantograph mechanical and operational requirements, environmental conditions, and maintainability and documentation requirements are specified. The standard also includes various testing methodologies and requirements</abstract>
