    <abstract>Identified in the 2014 published version of IEEE Std C57.12.38 is an error. Tw0 dimensions were provided for the high-voltage bushing height above the base of the transformer. The lower dimension (597+114/-13) should have been designated as being for units 167 kVA and 250 kVA only. The error is corrected in this corrigendum.</abstract>
