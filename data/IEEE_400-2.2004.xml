    <abstract>This guide describes very low frequency (VLF) withstand and diagnostic tests and the measurements that are performed in the field on shielded power cable systems. Whenever possible, cable systems are treated in a similar manner to individual cables. Tables are included as an aid to identifying the effectiveness of the VLF test for various cable system insulation problems.</abstract>
