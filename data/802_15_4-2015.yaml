abstract:
- content: The protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices
    using low-data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency
    (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network (WPAN) are defined in this
    standard. A variety of physical layers (PHYs) have been defined that cover a wide
    variety of frequency bands.
