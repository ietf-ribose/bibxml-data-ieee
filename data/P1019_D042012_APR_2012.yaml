abstract:
  content: Minimum requirements for the design, construction, manufacturing, testing,
    purchasing, and application of electric submersible pump cable are presented.
    The cable is round or flat, with polypropylene rubber insulation, nitrile or polyethylene
    jacket, and armor. These cables are for voltages not exceeding 3 kV or 5 kV (phase
    to phase) and conductor temperatures not exceeding 96 C (205 F) maximum for nitrile
    or a maximum minimum of -10 C (14 F) minimum. Conductors, insulation, assembly
    and with or without jacket, armor, requirements for testing by the manufacturer,
    and cable ampacity are all covered in the document.
