    <abstract>Superseded. Guidance is provided to management and engineers who wish to develop an integrated program for the application of human factors engineering (HFE) in the design, operation, and maintenance of nuclear power generating stations. The standard covers the program organization and applicability, the plant design aspects to consider, the HFE methodologies that may be used, and a typical program plan for the application of HFE. It is applicable to new facilities or modifications to existing facilities.</abstract>
