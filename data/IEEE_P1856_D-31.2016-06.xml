    <abstract>Information for the implementation of prognostics and health management (PHM) for electronic systems is described in this standard. A normative framework for classifying PHM capability and for planning the development of PHM for an electronic system or product is also described in this standard. Manufacturers and end users can use this standard for planning the appropriate prognostics and health management techniques to implement and the associated life cycle operations for the system of interest.</abstract>
