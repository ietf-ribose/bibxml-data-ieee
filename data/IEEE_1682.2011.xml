    <abstract>This standard provides general requirements, directions, and methods for qualifying fiber optic cables, connections, and optical fiber splices for use in safety systems of nuclear power generating stations, including fuel reprocessing stations and other related installations. Cables, optical fibers, and splices within or integral to other devices (e.g., sensors, instruments, panels, etc.) shall be qualified using the requirements in the applicable device standard or IEEE Std 323 -2003, as appropriate. However, the requirements of this standard may be applied to the fiber optic cable and interfaces within these devices.</abstract>
