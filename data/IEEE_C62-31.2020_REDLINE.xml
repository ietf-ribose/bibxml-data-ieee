    <abstract>This standard applies to low-voltage gas discharge tube (GDT ) surge-protective components for application on systems with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V rms or 1500 V dc. These protective components are designed to limit voltage surges on balanced or unbalanced communication circuits and on power circuits operating from dc to 420 Hz. This standard contains a series of standard test criteria for determining the electrical characteristics and ratings of gas discharge tube surge-protective components.</abstract>
