    <abstract>This project defines a standard protocol for secure authentication and creation of trust between a secure host and a directly attached Transient and other Storage Devices, such as a USB flash drive, portable hard drive, or cellular phone. The protocol has only an indirect relationship with data integrity/security, and does not directly address issues of authorization and enforcement. The protocol also does not address devices that are attached using a network connection. However, a device that uses a point-to-point wireless connection such as WUSB may comply with this protocol.</abstract>
