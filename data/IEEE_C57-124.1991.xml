    <abstract>IEEE Std C57.124-1991 covers the detection of partial discharges occurring in the insulation of dry-type transformers of their components and the measurement of the associated apparent charge at the terminals when alternating test voltage is applied. The wideband method is used. The detection system and calibrator characteristics are described, and the test procedure is established.</abstract>
