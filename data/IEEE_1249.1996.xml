    <abstract>The application, design concepts, and implementation of computer-based control systems for hydroelectric power plant automation is addressed. Functional capabilities, performance requirements, interface requirements, hardware considerations, and operator training are discussed. Recommendations for system testing and acceptance are provided, and case studies of actual computer-based control applications are presented.</abstract>
