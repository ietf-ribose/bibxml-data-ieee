abstract:
  content: Properties of commonly used jackets, as well as selection and testing of
    jackets, are covered in this guide. It is written for those responsible for optimizing
    cable designs. The purpose is to present a reasonably complete picture of the
    role of jackets so that the subject can be approached in an orderly and organized
    manner. An effort has been made to avoid the highly technical language and theory
    commonly used by electrical engineers and chemists to discuss the more detailed
    application of jackets.
