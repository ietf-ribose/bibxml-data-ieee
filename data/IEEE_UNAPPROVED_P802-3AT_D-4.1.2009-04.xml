    <abstract>The scope of this project is to augment the capabilities of the IEEE Std 802.3 standard with higher power levels and improved power management information. The project will augment the methodology for the provision of power via balanced cabling to connected Data Terminal Equipment with 802.3 interfaces. Optional augmented power limit will be made available for certain structured cabling systems. Compatibility with existing equipment will be maintained.</abstract>
