    <abstract>Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are set forth as well as certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz, mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers. These transformers are rated 5 MVA and smaller, with the high-voltage limit of 34.5 kV system nominal voltage and below, and with low-voltage limit of 15 kV system nominal voltage and below. This standard covers the connector, bushing, and terminal arrangements for radial- or loop-feed systems. This standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer.</abstract>
