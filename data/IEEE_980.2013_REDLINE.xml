    <abstract>The significance of oil-spillage regulations and their applicability to electric supply substations are discussed; the sources of oil spills are identified; typical designs and methods for dealing with oil containment and control of oil spills are discussed; and guidelines for preparation of a typical Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan are provided. This guide excludes polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) handling and disposal considerations.</abstract>
