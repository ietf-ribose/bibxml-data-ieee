    <abstract>Design and production tests and requirements for the integrity of submersible electrical equipment intended for installation in submerged or partially submerged environments are covered in this standard. These enclosures contain energized electrical apparatus, typically not accessible to the general public including, but not limited to, the following types of equipment: submersible distribution transformers; submersible network transformers; submersible network protectors; submersible switchgear; submersible capacitors or inductors; submersible junction enclosures; submersible metering equipment; and submersible control boxes.</abstract>
