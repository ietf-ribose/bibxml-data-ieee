    <abstract>The scope of the project is to cover measurements of the electrical properties of naturally occurring solids. Not covered are methods which rely on mapping earth structure anomalies unless directly related to electrical properties. Limited coverage of numerical methods for forward/inverse modeling.</abstract>
