abstract:
  content: This guide specifies test procedures to determine the efficiency and other
    performance characteristics of hermetic motors. Hermetic motors are electric motors
    designed to operate as integral parts of compressor units in refrigerators, air
    conditioners, and heat-pump systems. Such motors are normally manufactured for
    sale as component parts (that is, rotors and stators) intended for assembly by
    the compressor manufacturer. For this reason, the procedures set forth here are
    designed to determine the characteristics of a given rotor and stator under a
    standardized set of ambient conditions. Because of the wide variety of environmental
    conditions possible within a compressor, no attempt is made to simulate such operation.
    This guide deals with both single-phase and polyphase hermetic induction motors.
    Where test equipment or methods are critical to the accurate determination of
    motor performance, one or more suggested approaches are described.<<ETX>>
