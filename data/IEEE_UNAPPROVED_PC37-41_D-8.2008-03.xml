    <abstract>This standard specifies design test requirements for high-voltage (above 1000 V) fuses, distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, disconnecting cutouts, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for use on ac distribution systems. Devices with rated maximum voltages to 170kV are covered.</abstract>
