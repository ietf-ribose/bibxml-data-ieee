    <abstract>This standard applies to high-efÞciency TEFC, horizontal and vertical, single-speed, squirrel cage polyphase induction motors, up to and including 500 hp, in NEMA frame sizes 143T and larger, for petroleum, chemical, and other severe duty applications (commonly referred to as severe duty motors). Excluded from the scope of this standard are motors with sleeve bearings and additional speciÞc features required for explosion-proof motors.</abstract>
