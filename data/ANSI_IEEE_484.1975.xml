    <abstract>Proper installation design and installation procedures are prerequisite to long and reliable serviceof large stationary lead storage batteries. A definite need exists within the industry for recommendations that provide a uniform method for the design of the installation and the installation procedures of all batteries to meet station requirements. However, to provide practices that can be used immediately (especially for nuclear power generating stations), this document will limit its scope to the installation design and installation procedures of large stationary lead storage batteries. Included will be the seismic considerations for new battery installations.</abstract>
