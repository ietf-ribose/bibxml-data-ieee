    <abstract>This standard defines a baseline architectural framework and defines functional roles for blockchain-driven supply chain finance (SCF) implementations, e.g., core enterprise, supplier, bank, blockchain platform provider, and so on. The procedures of registration, asset issuance, asset transfer, financing based on asset on chain, asset clearing and settlement, and asset tracing, are explained. Finally, the technique requirement of the business system, and blockchain platform are discussed.</abstract>
