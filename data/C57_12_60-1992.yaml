abstract:
  content: A uniform method is established for determining the temperature classification
    of solidcast and resin-encapsulated power and distribution transformer insulation
    systems by testing rather than by chemical composition. These insulation systems
    are intended for use in transformers covered by IEEE Std C57.12.01-1989 and IEEE
    Std C57.12.91-1995 as they apply to solidcast and resin-encapsulated transformers
    whose highest voltages exceed nominal 600 V.
