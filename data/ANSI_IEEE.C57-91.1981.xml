    <abstract>General recommendations for loading 65 degrees Centigrade-rise mineral-oil-immersed overhead and pad-mounted distribution transformers are covered. Recommendations for 55 degrees Centigrade-rise transformers are included because a substantial percentage of these transformers are still in service. The recommendations are based on winding hottest-spot calculations only. Other factors that may limit the permissible load to lower values are listed. A method to establish winding temperature and loss of life by nomographs is given.</abstract>
