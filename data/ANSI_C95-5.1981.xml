    <abstract>Superseded; included in C95.3-1991. Techniques and instrumentation for the measurement of potentially hazardous electromagnetic fields are specified. The recommendations apply to hazards to personnel. However, the measurement techniques and instruments described are also applicable to the measurement of fields in the neighborhood of flammable materials and explosive devices, even though exposure standards for these situations have not been established.</abstract>
