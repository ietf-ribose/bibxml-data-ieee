    <abstract>This guide provides requirements and guidance for the seismic qualification of metal-enclosed power switchgear assemblies including switching, interrupting, control, instrumentation, metering, and protective and regulating devices mounted therein. As used in this guide, the word switchgear shall mean metal-enclosed power switchgear assemblies with the requirements as defined in IEEE Std C37.20.1, Standard for Metal-Enclosed Low-Voltage Power Circuit Breaker Switchgear, IEEE Std C37.20.2, Standard for Metal-Clad Switchgear, and IEEE Std C37.20.3, Standard for Metal-Enclosed Interrupter Switchgear. By definition, metal-enclosed power switchgear assemblies include metal-clad switchgear, metal-enclosed interrupter switchgear, and low-voltage power circuit breaker switchgear. This guide does not cover metal-enclosed bus or control switchboards.</abstract>
