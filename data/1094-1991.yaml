abstract:
  content: Design information and procedures for the interconnection of multiple wind
    turbines (a windfarm generating station) with an electrical utility are presented.
    Issues relating to the interface with the utility and the electrical system between
    the utility and the individual wind turbines (an intraplant electrical system)
    are addressed. Recommended practices for monitoring systems, protection systems,
    and safe operations for personnel and equipment are provided. The aim is to facilitate
    sound and economic engineering design and safe operations of a windfarm generating
    station.<<ETX>>
