    <abstract>This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access control layer (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint broadband wireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is structured to support multiple physical layer (PHY) specifications, each suited to a particular operational environment. The standard enables rapid worldwide deployment of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable multivendor broadband wireless access products, facilitates competition in broadband access by providing alternatives to wireline broadband access, encourages consistent worldwide spectrum allocations, and accelerates the commercialization of broadband wireless access systems. The standard is a revision of IEEEE Std 802.16-2004, and consolidates material from IEEE Std 802.16e<sup>TM</sup>-2005, IEEE 802.16-2004/Cor1-2005, IEEE 802.16f<sup>TM</sup>-2005, and IEEE Std 802.16g<sup>TM</sup>-2007, along with additional maintenance items and enhancements to the management information base specifications. This revision supersedes and makes obsolete IEEE Std 802.16-2004 and all of its subsequent amendments and corrigenda.</abstract>
