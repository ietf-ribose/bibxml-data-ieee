    <abstract>Uniform and minimum requirements for the format and content of software verification and validation (V&amp;V) tasks and their required inputs and outputs that are to be included in SVVPs are provided for both critical and noncritical software. For critical software, specific minimum verification and validation (V&amp;V) tasks and their required inputs and outputs that are to be included in SVVPs are defined. Optional V&amp;V tasks to be used to tailor SVVPs as appropriate for the particular V&amp;V effort are suggested. An overview of V&amp;V is given, and life-cycle V&amp;V, software V&amp;V reporting, and V&amp;V administrative procedures are covered.</abstract>
