    <abstract>Specification and test requirements for a single-axis Coriolis vibratory gyro (CVG) for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. A standard specification format guide for the preparation of a single-axis CVG is provided. A compilation of recommended procedures for testing a CVG, derived from those presently used in the industry, is also provided. Informative annexes cover CVG design features and theoretical principles of operation.</abstract>
