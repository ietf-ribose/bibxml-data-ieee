    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE Std 982.1-2005 A set of measures indicative of software reliability that can be applied to the software product as well as to the development and support processes is provided. The measures can be applied early in the development process to indicate the reliability of the delivered product. The aim is to provide a common set of definitions that allows a meaningful exchange of data and evaluations to occur, and that serves as the foundation on which researchers and practitioners can build consistent methods. The standard is designed to assist management in directing product development and support toward specific reliability goals.</abstract>
