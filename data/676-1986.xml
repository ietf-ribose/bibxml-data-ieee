    <abstract>This guide provides guidelines for the organization of fossil-fueled power generating plant alarm and monitoring information into types and categories, taking into consideration information usefulness and limitations. This guide further serves to establish guidelines for correlating type and category of alarm and monitoring information with the appropriate information-display devices. Adherence to the categorization and the corresponding information-display techniques presents prioritized alarm and monitoring information to the operator which is appropriately proportioned between the window annunciator, CRT, mimic display, and printer. This also permits a reduction in the number of window annunciators over historic practices.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
