    <abstract>Recommendations regarding mineral oil tests and evaluation procedures are made in this guide; references are made to methods of reconditioning and reclaiming conventional petroleum (mineral) dielectric insulating liquids; the levels at which these methods become necessary; and the routines for restoring oxidation resistance, where required, by the addition of oxidation inhibitors. The intent is to assist the power equipment operator in evaluating the serviceability of mineral oil received in equipment, oil as received from the supplier for filling new equipment at the installation site, and oil as processed into such equipment; and to assist the operator in maintaining mineral oil in serviceable condition. The mineral oil covered is used in transformers, reactors, load tap changers, and voltage regulators.</abstract>
