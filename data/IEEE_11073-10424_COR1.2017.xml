    <abstract>Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device communication, a normative definition of the communication between sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment (SABTE) devices (agents) and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set-top boxes), in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability, is established in IEEE Std 11073-10424-2014. It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. IEEE Std 11073-10424-2014 defines a common core of communication functionality for SABTE. In this context, SABTE is defined as a device that is intended to alleviate the symptoms of a patient who suffers from sleep apnoea by delivering a therapeutic breathing pressure to the patient. SABTE is primarily used in the home health-care environment by a lay operator without direct professional supervision. This corrigendum corrects errors that have been identified in IEEE Std 11073-10424-2014 to make it easier to implement the standard in an interoperable fashion.</abstract>
