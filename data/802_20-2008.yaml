abstract:
- content: The technical requirements of this standard form a compatibility standard
    for mobile broadband wireless access systems. The standard ensures that a compliant
    access terminal (AT) or user terminal (UT) can obtain service through any access
    node (AN) or base station (BS) conforming to properly selected modes of this standard,
    consistent with equipment and operator requirements, thus providing a framework
    for the rapid development of cost-effective, multivendor mobile broadband wireless
    access systems. This compatibility standard is targeted for use in a wide variety
    of licensed frequency bands and regulatory environments.This standard provides
    for future standardized extension capabilities. The architecture defined by this
    standard permits such expansion without the loss of backward compatibility.

    service additions and expansion of system standardized extension capabilities.
    The architecture defined by this specification standard permits such expansion
    without the loss of backward compatibility to older access terminals or user terminals.
