    <abstract>This document provides specifications for a high-speed serial bus which supports both asynchronous and isochronous communication and integrates well with most IEEE standard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses. It is intended to provide a low-cost interconnect between cards on the same backplane, cards on other backplanes, and external peripherals. Interfaces to longer-distance transmission media (such as UTP, optical fiber, and POF) allow the interconnection to be extended throughout a local network. This standard follows the IEEE Std 1212â„¢ -2001 Command and Status Register (CSR) architecture.</abstract>
