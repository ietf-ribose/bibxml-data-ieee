abstract:
  content: 'The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People''s Republic
    of China has approved the 174-216 MHz, 407-425 MHz and 608-630 MHz bands for medical
    information transmission. China Medical Band (CMB) devices operating within these
    bands conform to a set of rules specified in China, Ministry of Industry and Information
    Technology Doc: 423-2005, which restricts use of the band to only medical, non-voice
    use under direction of a healthcare practitioner, among other requirements. This
    standard defines a PHY for devices operating on Chinese approved bands for medical
    signals.'
