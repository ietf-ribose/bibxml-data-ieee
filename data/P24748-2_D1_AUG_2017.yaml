abstract:
  content: This document specifies requirements and procedures for managing information
    for users throughout the software-, services-, and systems-development life cycle.
    It applies to people or organizations producing suites of information, to those
    undertaking a single information-development project, and to information produced
    internally, as well as to information contracted to outside service organizations.
    It provides details of the information-development and project-management processes
    and also presents aspects of strategic planning and translation management that
    managers apply. It covers management activities related to starting a project,
    building a team, and managing information through the translation and localization
    process. It addresses productivity and quality measurements needed for management
    control. This document is independent of the software tools that may be used to
    produce or manage information for users and applies to both printed, embedded,
    and mobile information. Much of its guidance is applicable to information for
    users of systems of hardware as well as software, systems, and services.
