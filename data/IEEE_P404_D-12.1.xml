    <abstract>Std. 404-2000, IEEE Standard for Extruded and Laminated Dielectric Shielded Cable Joints Rated 2 500v to 500 000v, will be revised to incorporate: 1) design tests for joint environmental seals; 2) quality control requirements for production lots of heat shrinkable joint designs; 3) metallic shielding performance criteria; and 4) additional temperature / current rating performance criteria. These revisions will be harmonized with international standards wherever possible.</abstract>
