    <abstract>Information is provided for selecting the proper circuit breaker for a particular application. This recommended practice helps the application engineer specify the type of circuit breaker, ratings, trip functions, accessories, acceptance tests, and maintenance requirements. It also discusses circuit breakers for special applications, e.g., instantaneous only and switches. In addition, it provides information for applying circuit breakers at different locations in the power system, and for protecting specific components. Guidelines are also given for coordinating combinations of line-side and load-side devices.</abstract>
