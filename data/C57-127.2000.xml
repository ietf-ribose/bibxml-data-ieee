    <abstract>This guide is applicable to the detection and location of acoustic emissions from partial discharges and other sources in oil immersed power transformers and reactors. It is intended to provide a means of associating the relative magnitude and position of partial discharges and other sources with the acoustic signals obtained by strategically located transducers.</abstract>
