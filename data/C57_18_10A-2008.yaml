abstract:
- content: This standard practice provides rating data, construction requirements,
    testing and calculation methods for dry-type or liquid-filled semiconductor power
    rectifier transformers. These transformers supply nonsinusoidal load currents
    and are subject to higher harmonic load losses than standard power transformers.
    A number of examples illustrating harmonic loss calculations are presented in
    a reference annex.
