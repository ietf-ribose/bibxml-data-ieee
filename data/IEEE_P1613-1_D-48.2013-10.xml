    <abstract>Environmental testing requirements are defined for communications networkingdevices to be installed in transmission and distribution facilities. This standard establishes acommon reproducible basis for designing and evaluating devices utilizing radio frequency (RF) upto 6 GHz, power line communications, and broadband over power line (BPL) technologies. It alsorequires immunity to five IEC electromagnetic compatibility standards for which there are no IEEEequivalent standards. This standard is an extension to IEEE Std 1613(tm)-2009 and IEEE Std1613a(tm)-2011.</abstract>
