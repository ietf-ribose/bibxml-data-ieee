    <abstract>This standard provides definitions of switching system performance in a telecommunications environment. It includes parameters in seven categories: (1) customer access; (2) network reliability; (3) billing; (4) transmission; (5) operating company; (6) customer signaling; (7) network service; The dimensions and critical aspects of each parameter are presented without numerical values. The definitions will facilitate a description of switching requirements for different networks and applications. Each application may be characterized by its own set of parameters and values. This standard provides definitions that will promote a consistent interpretation of performance by users, service providers, manufacturers, and designers.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
