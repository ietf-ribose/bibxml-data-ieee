    <abstract>Preparation of material incorporated in this report has been undertaken by the AIEE in the belief that it will materially aid in the realization of a better aircraft electric system. This conviction is confirmed by opinions expressed in joint meetings, including representation from SAE, NASC, NEMA, Army Air Forces, and the Bureau of Aeronautics.</abstract>
