    <abstract>The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide guidelines for the proper application of electrical equipment to packaging machinery which will promote: (1) Safety to personnel and equipment, including the reduction of fire and accident hazard (2) Uninterrupted production (3) Long life and low maintenance cost This is a minimum recommended practice and is not intended to limit or inhibit advancement in the areas of electrical or mechanical engineering. This recommended practice covers the application of electrical equipment and wiring furnished as part of a packaging machine, and associated equipment commencing at the place of connection of the power supply. It shall apply to electrical equipment for use on circuits which operate from a supply voltage of 600 V or less. It shall not be considered adequate for machines intended for use in locations designated as hazardous by the NEC (National Electric Code), NFPA 70-1971 (ANSI C1-1971).</abstract>
