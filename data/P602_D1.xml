  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">To provide a recommended practice for the design and operation of electric systems in health care facilities. The term health care facility, as used here, encompasses buildings or parts of buildings that contain hospitals, nursing homes, residential custodial care facilities, clinics, and medical and dental offices. Buildings or parts of buildings within an industrial or commercial complex, used as medical facilities, logically fall within the scope of this recommended practice.</abstract>
