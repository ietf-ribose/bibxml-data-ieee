abstract:
- content: MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability and general information relevant
    to specific MAC types are defined in this standard. Link Aggregation allows parallel
    full-duplex point-to-point links to be used as if they were a single link and
    also supports the use of multiple links as a resilient load sharing interconnect
    between multiple nodes in two separately administered networks.
