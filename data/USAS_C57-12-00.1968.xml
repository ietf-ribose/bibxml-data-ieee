    <abstract>This standard was revised and greatly expanded in 1948, 1949, and 1956. The 1956 edition was comprised of a revision and editorial consolidation of the preceding standards on distribution, power , and regulating transformers, namely American Standard Requirements for Distribution, Power , and Regulating Transformers, and Reactors Other Than Current-Limiting Reactors, C57.12-1949, American Standard Test Code for Distribution , Power, and Regulating Transformers , C57.22-1948, and American Standard Requirements for Transformers-67,000 Volts and Below; 501 Through 10,000 kva, 3 Phase ; 501 Through 5,000 kva, 1 Phase, C57.12a-1954. In addition, in order to eliminate cross-references wherever possible, the consolidation contained excerpts from other standards of the C57 family</abstract>
