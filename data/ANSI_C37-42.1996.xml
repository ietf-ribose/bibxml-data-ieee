    <abstract>This standard is one of a series of complementary standards covering various types of high-voltage fuses and switches, arranged so that certain standards apply to all devices while other standards provide additional specifications for a particular device. For any device, ANSI/IEEE C37.40-1993, ANSI/IEEE C37.41-1994, plus the additional standard covering that device, constitute a complete standard for the device. In addition, ANSI/IEEE C37.48-1987 (R1992) is an application, operation, and maintenance guide for all the devices.</abstract>
