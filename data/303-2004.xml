    <abstract>This recommended practice applies to the application and installation procedures of auxiliary devices in or on electric rotating machines that are employed in hazardous locations classified as Class 1, Division 2 or Class I Zone 2 under commonly used worldwide regulations. These regulations are: the National Electrical Code (United States); the Canadian Electrical Code, Part 1 (Canada); and combined practices of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), and Standards Australia / Standards New Zealand (AS/NZS). Included is a list of source documents, definitions and nomenclature. Devices include terminal housings, heaters, surge protection, power factor correction capacitors, shaft grounding, and enclosures. Special marking requirements are also discussed</abstract>
