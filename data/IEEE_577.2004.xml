    <abstract>This standard sets forth minimum acceptable requisites for the performance of reliability analyses for safety-related systems of nuclear facilities when used to address the reliability requirements identified in regulations and other standards. The requirement that a reliability analysis be performed does not originate with this standard. However, when reliability analysis is used to demonstrate compliance with reliability requirements, this standard describes an acceptable response to the requirements.</abstract>
