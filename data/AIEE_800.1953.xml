    <abstract>It is the purpose of this code to define uniform acceptable methods of making tests to determine that the performance and other characteristics of d-c rotating machines for aircraft comply with specification and application requirements. This code covers rotating machines which operate from or are connected to a direct-current system of an aircraft.</abstract>
