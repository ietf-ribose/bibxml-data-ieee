abstract:
  content: Guidelines are provided for Temporary Protective Grounding (TPG) of electric
    power lines to assist in protection of workers from voltages and currents that
    might develop at a de-energized worksite during maintenance of ac overhead and
    underground, transmission and distribution lines, cables, and equipment. Other
    forms of worker protection include isolation and insulation. These methods are
    described in other documents and guides and are not discussed here.
