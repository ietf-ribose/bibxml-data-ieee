abstract:
  content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802-2014 provides an optional local MAC address
    space structure, known as the Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP), to allow multiple
    administrations to coexist. This structure designates a range of local MAC addresses
    for protocols using a Company ID (CID) assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority.
    Another range of local MAC addresses is designated for assignment by administrators.
    The amendment recommends a range of local MAC addresses for use by IEEE 802 protocols.
