abstract:
  content: A description is given of field-test methods that will ensure that the
    current transformers used as a source of relay input current are connected properly,
    are of marked ratio and polarity, and are in condition to perform as designed
    both initially and after a period of service. The standard covers safety considerations;
    current transformer types and construction and the effect of these on test methods;
    insulation resistance tests; ratio tests; polarity check; winding and lead resistance
    (internal resistance); excitation tests; burden measurements; and specialized
    situations.
