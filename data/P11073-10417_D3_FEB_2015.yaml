abstract:
  content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for devicecommunication,
    a normative definition of communication between personal telehealth glucosemeter
    devices and compute engines (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal healthappliances,
    and set top boxes) is established by this standard in a manner that enables plug-andplayinteroperability.
    Appropriate portions of existing standards are leveraged, including ISO/IEEE11073
    terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport
    standards.The use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth
    environments restrictingoptionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability
    are specified. A common core ofcommunication functionality for personal telehealth
    glucose meters is defined in this standard.
