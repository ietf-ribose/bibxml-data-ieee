abstract:
  content: This document prescribes the mechanical, electrical, and test requirements
    for the design, construction, and. installation of electrical penetration assemblies
    in containment structures for stationary nuclear fueled power generating stations.
    The electrical conductor and insulation characteristics of external circuits which
    connect to penetration assemblies are beyond the scope of these criteria. If there
    should be any conflict between this document and those documents referenced herein,
    this document shall take precedence over the referenced documents.
