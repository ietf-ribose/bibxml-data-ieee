    <abstract>Electrical ratings and test requirements of cable joints used with extruded and laminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 2.5 kV to 500 kV are established in this standard. In addition, test requirements for joint metallic-shield and jacketing components are defined. A variety of common joint constructions are also defined. This standard has been designed to provide uniform testing procedures that can be used by manufacturers and users to evaluate the ability of underground power cable joints, and associated metallic-shields and jacketing components, to perform reliably in service.</abstract>
