abstract:
  content: This Recommended Practice encompasses the monitoring of electrical characteristics
    of single-phase and polyphase ac power systems. It includes consistent descriptions
    of conducted electromagnetic phenomena occurring on power systems. The document
    describes nominal conditions and deviations from these nominal conditions that
    may originate within the source of supply or load equipment, or from interactions
    between the source and the load. Also, this document discusses power quality monitoring
    devices, application techniques, and interpretation of monitoring results.
