    <abstract>Uniform minimum acceptable requirements for the performance of reliability analyses for safety-related systems found in nuclear power generating stations are provided. The requirements can be applied during design, fabrication, testing, maintenance, and repair of systems and components in nuclear power plants. The timing of the analysis depends upon the purpose for which it is performed.</abstract>
