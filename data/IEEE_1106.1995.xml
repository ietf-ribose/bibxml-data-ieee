    <abstract>Installation design, installation, maintenance and testing procedures, and test schedules that can be used to optimize the life and performance of vented nickel-cadmium batteries used for continuous-float operations are provided. Guidance for determining when these batteries should be replaced is also provided. This recommended practice is applicable to all stationary applications. However, specific applications, such as alternative energy, emergency lighting units, and semiportable equipment, may have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Sizing, qualification, other battery types, and battery application are beyond the scope of this recommended practice.</abstract>
