    <abstract>OpenFog Consortium--OpenFog Reference Architecture for Fog Computing is adopted by this standard. OpenFog Reference Architecture [OPFRA001.020817] is a structural and functional prescription of an open, interoperable, horizontal system architecture for distributing computing, storage, control and networking functions closer to the users along a cloud-to-thing continuum of communicating, computing, sensing and actuating entities. It encompasses various approaches to disperse Information Technology (IT), Communication Technology (CT) and Operational Technology (OT) Services through information messaging infrastructure as well as legacy and emerging multi-access networking technologies</abstract>
