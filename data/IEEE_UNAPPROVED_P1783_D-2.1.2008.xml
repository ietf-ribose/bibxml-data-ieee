    <abstract>IEEE-DEIS and PES Task Forces on insulator icing have been refining test methods for freezing conditions, including ice and snow, since 1999. This guide consolidates the discussion and recommends specific, appropriate and reproducible test methods for selecting adequate insulators. The scope includes test methods for substation and line insulators at distribution and transmission voltage levels. The test methods detail special measures to reproduce the environmental and insulator parameters that influence the risk of flashover in freezing conditions. Statistical methods are also recommended to assist in the insulator selection process.</abstract>
