    <abstract>Electrical, mechanical, and safety requirements are set forth for liquid-immersed distribution and power transformers, and autotransformers and regulating transformers; single and polyphase, with voltages of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding. This standard is the basis for the establishment of performance, limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and safety requirements of equipment described; and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment. The requirements in this standard apply to all liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers except the following: instrument transformers; step-voltage and induction voltage regulators; arc furnace transformers; rectifier transformers; specialty transformers; grounding transformers, mobile transformers; and mine transformers.</abstract>
