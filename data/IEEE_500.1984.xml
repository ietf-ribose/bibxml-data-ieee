    <abstract>This guide applies to reliability data of electrical, electronic, sensing component, and mechanical equipment. It is intended to establish one method of collecting and presenting reliability data for use in nuclear-power generating station reliability calculations as outlined in IEEE Std 352-1975, IEEE Guide for General Principles of Reliability Analysis of Nuclear-Power Generating Station Protection Systems. The data contained in Appendix D are intended for the use of either nuclear systems reliability analysts or design engineers. </abstract>
