abstract:
- content: 'A stationary battery can be operated in two basic modes: 1) standby (or
    float) and 2) cycling. Many standards developed for standby stationary applications
    do not apply to cycling stationary applications, and vice versa. The purpose of
    this guide is to differentiate between these two applications and increase awareness
    of why and how their different operation and maintenance practices should be managed.
    The guide is primarily informational and is not intended to provide specific recommendations
    for battery management in cycling applications.'

- content: This guide provides information on the differences between stationary standby
    and stationary cycling applications and appropriate battery management strategies
    in cycling operations. While the primary emphasis is on lead-acid batteries, information
    is also provided on alternative and emerging storage technologies. The management
    of battery systems in stationary standby service is covered in other IEEE documents
    and is beyond the scope of this guide.
