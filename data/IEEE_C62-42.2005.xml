    <abstract>Assistance in selecting the most appropriate type of low-voltage component surge-protective device (gas tube, air gap, metal-oxide varistor, or avalanche junction semiconductor) for a particular application is provided. Evaluation of the characteristics of each device to meet specific service requirements is also given.</abstract>
