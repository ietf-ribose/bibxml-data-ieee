    <abstract>Directions for establishing type tests that may be used in qualifying Class 1E electric cables, field splices, and other connections for service in nuclear power generating stations are provided. Though intended primarily for cable for field installation, this guide may also be used for the qualification of internal wiring of manufactured devices. It does not cover cables for service within the reactor vessel.</abstract>
