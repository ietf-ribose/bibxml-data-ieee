abstract:
  content: This recommended practice prescribes the methods for assessing and predicting
    the reliability of software, based on a life cycle approach to software reliability
    engineering. It provides information necessary for the application of software
    reliability measurement to a project, lays a foundation for building consistent
    methods, and establishes the basic principle for collecting the data needed to
    assess and predict the reliability of software. The document prescribes how any
    user can participate in software reliability assessments and predictions.
