    <abstract>A stationary battery can be operated in two basic modes: 1) standby (or float), and 2) cycling. Many standards developed for standby stationary applications do not apply to cycling stationary applications, and vice versa. The purpose of this guide is to differentiate between these two applications and increase awareness of why and how their different operation and maintenance practices should be managed. The guide is primarily informational and is not intended to provide specific recommendations for battery management in cycling applications.</abstract>
