    <abstract>A method is provided for specifying power intent for an electronic design, for use in verification of the structure and behavior of the design in the context of a given power management architecture, and for driving implementation of that power-management architecture. The method supports incremental refinement of power-intent specifications required for IP-based design flows.</abstract>
