    <abstract>The interdisciplinary tasks that are required throughout a system's life cycle to transform customer needs, requirements, and constraints into a system solution are defined. This standard applies to a performing activity within an enterprise that is responsible for developing a product design and establishing the life cycle infrastructure needed to provide for life cycle sustainment. It specifies the requirements for the systems engineering process and its application throughout the product life cycle. The requirements of this standard are applicable to new products as well as incremental enhancements to existing products</abstract>
