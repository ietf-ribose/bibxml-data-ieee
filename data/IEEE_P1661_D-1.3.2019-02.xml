    <abstract>This guide is specifically prepared for a PV/engine generator hybrid power system, but may also be applicable to all hybrid power systems where there is at least one renewable power source, such as PV, and a dispatchable power source, such as an engine generator. Taper-charge parameters for PV hybrid systems are suggested to help in preparing the battery for a capacity test. A test procedure is provided to ensure appropriate data acquisition, battery characterization, and capacity measurements. Finally, a process to review test results and make appropriate decisions regarding the battery is provided. No cycle-life predictions are made.</abstract>
