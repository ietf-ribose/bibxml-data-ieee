    <abstract>This standard describes certain electrical and mechanical characteristics and takes into consideration certain safety features of 60-Hz, two-winding, ventilated dry-type transformers with self-cooled ratings 1 to 500 kVA, single-phase, and 15 to 500 kVA, three-phase, inclusive; high-voltage 601 to 34 500 volts, and low-voltage 120 to 600 volts, inclusive; generally used for step-down purposes. (Forced-air-cooled ratings for certain sizes are listed in Part II.)</abstract>
