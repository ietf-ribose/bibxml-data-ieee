    <abstract>General and specific recommendations for grounding current and voltage transformer secondary circuits and cases of connected equipment are covered in this guide. Although most diagrams included in this guide show relaying applications, the recommended practices applyequally to metering and other areas where instrument transformers are used. Grounding practices presently used, and practices that were not previously reported, are included in this guide. Specifically, a review of other than North American grounding practices is included.</abstract>
