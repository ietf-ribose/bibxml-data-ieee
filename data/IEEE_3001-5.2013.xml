    <abstract>The selection and application of power distribution apparatus used in industrial and commercial power systems are covered in this recommended practice. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience with this equipment. It can also bean aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.</abstract>
