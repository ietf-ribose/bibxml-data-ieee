    <abstract>This standard establishes minimum performance criteria and test requirements for four categories of alarming electronic radiation detectors used to manage exposure by alerting the emergency responders when they are exposed to photon radiation. The instruments provide rapid and clear indication of the level of radiation exposure and/or exposure rate and readily recognizable alarms. The alarms are both audible and visual, and distinguishable betweenexposure rate and exposure.</abstract>
