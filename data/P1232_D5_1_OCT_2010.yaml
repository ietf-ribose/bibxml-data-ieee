abstract:
- content: AI-ESTATE defines data interchange and for standard software services for
    test and diagnostic environments. The purpose of AI-ESTATE is to standardize interfaces
    for functional elements of an intelligent diagnostic reasoner and representations
    of diagnostic knowledge and data for use by such diagnostic reasoners. Formal
    information models are defined to form the basis for a format to facilitate exchange
    of persistent diagnostic information between two reasoners, and also to provide
    a formal typing system for diagnostic services. This standard also defines the
    services to control a diagnostic reasoner.
