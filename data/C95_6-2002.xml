    <abstract>Recommendations are given to prevent harmful effects in human beings exposed to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range of 0Â­3 kHZ. The recommendations are intended to apply to exposures of the general public, as well as to individuals in controlled environments. They are not intended to apply to the purposeful exposure of patients by or under the direction of practitioners of the healing arts and may not be protective with respect to the use of medical devices or implants. A rationale that describes how the recommendations were arrived at, and the factors taken into account in formulating them, is included.</abstract>
