    <abstract>Practices are provided for establishing procedures that will yield data to demonstrate that the equipment can meet its performance requirements during and/or following one safe shutdown earthquake event preceded by a number of operating basis earthquake events. This standard may be used to establish tests, analyses, or experienced-based evaluations that will yield data to demonstrate equipment performance claims or to evaluate and verify performance of devices and assemblies as part of an overall qualification effort. Common methods currently in use for seismic qualification by test are presented. Two approaches to seismic analysis are described, one based on dynamic analysis and the other on static coefficient analysis. Two approaches to experienced-based seismic evaluation are described, one based on earthquake experience and the other based on test experience.</abstract>
