  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">The Core Test Language (CTL) is a language created for a System-on-Chip flow (or SoC flow), where a design created by one group is reused as a sub-design of a design created by another group. In an SoC flow, the smaller design embedded in the larger design is commonly called a core and the larger design is commonly called the SoC. The core is a design provided by a core provider, and the task of incorporating the sub-design into the SoC is called Core System Integration.</abstract>
