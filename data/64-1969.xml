    <abstract>This Guide attempts to assist the power equipment operator in evaluating oil received in equipment and as filled at the installation site and to assist also in his efforts to maintain his oil in serviceable condition. It recommends and standardizes oil test and evaluation procedures, methods of reconditioning and reclaiming oil when necessary, and routines for restoring oxidation resistance by additions of inhibitors.</abstract>
