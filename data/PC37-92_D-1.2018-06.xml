    <abstract>Electronic devices that develop or utilize analog signals are not presently covered by standards. This Standard provides interface connectivity of modern power-system signal transducers based on electronics, such as magneto-optic current transducers, and electronic relays. The existing standardized levels from familiar magnetic current and voltage transformers are not readily generated by new types of electronic signal transducers.</abstract>
