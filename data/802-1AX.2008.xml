    <abstract>Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group, such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links, consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent link aggregation capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support link aggregation.</abstract>
