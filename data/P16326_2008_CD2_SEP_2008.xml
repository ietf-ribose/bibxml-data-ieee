    <abstract>This project is a revision of IEEE Std 1058-1998 (IEEE Standard for Software Project Management Plans) to become an international standard by merging it with an existing ISO/IEC Technical Report 16326-1999 (Software engineering -- Guide for the application of ISO/IEC 12207 to Project Management). The current ISO/IEC TR 16326 provides guidance to people responsible for managing the performance of the primary software life cycle processes of ISO/IEC 12207-1995 (IEEE/EIA 12207.0 - Information technology -- Software life cycle processes). The process guidance provided by the current Technical Report will be updated. From IEEE Std 1058 will come normative provisions for the content of a software project management plan. To incorporate both process guidance and document requirements, it is within the scope of the project to develop a one-part standard or a multi-part standard. Furthermore, depending on the pace of SC7 harmonization activities, it is permitted to extend the scope of this effort to system-level project management.</abstract>
