    <abstract>This standard specifies how the MAC Service is supported by Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks, the principles of operation of those networks, and the operation of VLAN-aware Bridges, including management, protocols, and algorithms. The amendments that were specified in IEEE Std 802.1AD enable a service provider to use the architecture and protocols defined in this standard to offer the equivalent of separate LANs, Bridged Local Area Networks, or Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks to a number of customers, while requiring no cooperation between the customers, and minimal cooperation between each customer and the service provider.</abstract>
