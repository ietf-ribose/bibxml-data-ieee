    <abstract>This recommended practice provides recommendations for the testing, design, installation, and maintenance of electrical resistance heat tracing in general industries as applied to mechanical piping and equipment. The electrical resistance heat tracing is in the form of series-heating cables and parallel-heating cables. The recommendations also include test criteria to determine the suitability of heating cables which are utilized for these applications.</abstract>
