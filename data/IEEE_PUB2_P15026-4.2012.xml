    <abstract>Guidance and recommendations for conducting selected processes, activities, and tasks for systems and software products requiring assurance claims for properties selected for special attention (called critical properties) are given in this adoption of ISO/IEC 15026-4:2012. IEEE Std 15026-4-2013 specifies a property-independent list of processes, activities and tasks to achieve the claim and show the achievement of the claim. IEEE Std 15026-4-2013 establishes the processes, activities, tasks, guidance, and recommendations in the context of a defined life cycle model and set of life cycle processes for system and/or software life cycle management.</abstract>
