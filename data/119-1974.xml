    <abstract>The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for the application of temperature-measurement techniques in measuring the operating temperature and temperature rise of electrical machines, instruments, and apparatus in common use. The guidelines are limited to measurement of temperatures below 500 degrees C; however, some measurement techniques described herein are capable of measuring temperatures above 500 degrees C, and these may be used at the higher temperatures after the validity and safety of the technique for the temperature involved have been confirmed. This recommended practice does not define permissible temperature rise or corrections since they must form a part of the standard for the particular apparatus involved. Should contradiction between guidelines stated herein and those in a specific apparatus test procedure or standard exist, the specific apparatus publication will govern.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
