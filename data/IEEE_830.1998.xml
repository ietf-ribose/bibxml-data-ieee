    <abstract>Replaced by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011. The content and qualities of a good software requirements specification (SRS) are described and several sample SRS outlines are presented. This recommended practice is aimed at specifying requirements of software to be developed but also can be applied to assist in the selection of in-house and commercial software products. Guidelines for compliance with IEEE/ EIA12207.1- 1997 are also provided.</abstract>
