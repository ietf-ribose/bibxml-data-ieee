    <abstract>Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device communication, the landscape of transport-independent applications and information profiles for personal telehealth devices is described in this guide. Defined in these profiles are data exchange, data representation, and terminology for communication between personal telehealth devices and compute engines (e.g., health appliances, set top boxes, cell phones, and personal computers). A definition of personal telehealth devices as devices used for life activity, wellness monitoring, and/or health monitoring in domestic home, communal home, and/or mobile applications is provided in this guide. Use cases relevant to these scenarios and environments are also presented.</abstract>
