abstract:
  content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.32008 defines the Time Synchronization Service
    Interface(TSSI) to indicate when the SFD crosses the generic Medium Independent
    Interface (xMII), together with management objects indicating transmission latency
    between the MDI and xMII for the given PHY. Both features are required to support
    IEEE Std P802.1AS-201X.
