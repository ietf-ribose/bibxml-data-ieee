    <abstract>Digital recorders and digital oscilloscopes used for measurements during tests with high-impulse voltages and high-impulse currents are considered. Terms specifically related to the digital recorders used for monitoring high-voltage and high-current impulse tests are defined. The performance characteristics for such recorders, necessary to ensure their compliance with the requirements for high-voltage and for high-current impulse tests, are specified. The tests and procedures that are necessary to show that these performance characteristics are within those specified limits are indicated.</abstract>
