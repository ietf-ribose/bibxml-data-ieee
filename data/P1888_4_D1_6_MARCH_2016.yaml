abstract:
  content: 'This standard provides protocols for measurement and control networks
    for home and residential quarters so that they can achieve green, smarter functions.
    It specifies the interactive data format between devices and systems; and it gives
    standardized definitions of the sensor, actuator, and equipment, together with
    the data communication processes. This standard also includes: The data format
    definition for configuration and management-oriented functions; The data format
    definition for deployment and control-oriented functions; The method definition
    for conformance tests and interoperability tests.'
