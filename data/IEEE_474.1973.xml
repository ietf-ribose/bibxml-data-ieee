    <abstract>This performance standard covers absorptive and reflective attenuators, both fixed as well as continuously variable or variable in fixed steps, both manual and programmable types. It does not cover electronic or solid state-type attenuators. This standard permits the user to select for a specification those minimum performance parameters which characterize an attenuator. A list of preferred test methods is included permitting verification of the attenuation characteristics. Practical minimum performance limits are furnished for various applications. These are for guidance only and will improve with time.</abstract>
