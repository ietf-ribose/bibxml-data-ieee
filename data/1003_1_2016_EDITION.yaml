- content: 'POSIX.1-2008 is simultaneously IEEE Std Specifications, Issue 7. This
    2016 Edition includes 1003.1-2008/Cor 2-2016 incorporated into IEEE Corrigenda
    address problems discovered since the approval of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008. POSIX.1-2008
    defines a standard operating system interface and environment, including a command
    interpreter (or &#x201C;shell&#x201D;), and common utility programs to support
    applications portability at the source code level. POSIX.1-2008 is intended to
    be used by both application developers and system implementors and comprises four
    major components (each in an associated volume): General terms, concepts, and
    interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including utility conventions
    and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume.
    Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific system
    services for the C programming language, function issues, including portability,
    error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume.
    Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation
    services (a &#x201C;shell&#x201D;) and common utility programs for application
    programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume. Extended rationale that
    did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, which contains historical
    information concerning the contents of POSIX.1-2008 and why features were included
    or discarded by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative)
    volume.'
