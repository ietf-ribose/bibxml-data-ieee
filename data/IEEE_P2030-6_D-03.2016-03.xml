    <abstract>This draft guide proposed a framework for monitoring the effects and evaluating comprehensive benefits of demand response programs. From perspectives of ex ante and ex post evaluation, the draft guide introduces the contents including the evaluation processes on demand response effects with its comprehensive benefits, and implemented calculation methods in detail. This guide could be applied in various electricity market structures to provide utilities the references for the planning, design, implementation and post-evaluation of demand response programs.</abstract>
