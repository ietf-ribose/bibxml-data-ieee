    <abstract>This IEEE Standards product is part of the C57 family on Power Distribution and Regulating Transformers. Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.01-1989 and other referenced standards applicable to dry-type distribution and power transformers are described. This standard is intended for use as a basis for performance, safety, and the proper testing of dry-type distribution and power transformers. This standard applies to all dry-type transformers except instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, and mine transformers.</abstract>
