    <abstract>This standard covers certain mechanical requirements for liquid-immersed distribution transformers in respect to tank strength as well as static and dynamic tank pressure mitigation. This standard can be applied to various tank configurations for distribution transformers. This standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer. It is intended to define the mechanical performance requirements to prevent permanent tank distortion or rupture of distribution transformers covered under this standard. These requirements will provide a more standard design of transformer tank and associated components related with both static and dynamic pressure coordination.</abstract>
