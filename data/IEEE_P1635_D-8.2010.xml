    <abstract>Ventilation of stationary battery installations is critical to maximize battery life while minimizing the hazards associated with hydrogen production. This guide is applicable to vented lead acid, valve-regulated lead acid, and nickel cadmium stationary battery installations and was written to serve as a bridge between the electrical designer and the HVAC designer. It describes battery operating modes and the hazards associated with each. It provides the HVAC designer with the information to provide a cost effective ventilation solution.</abstract>
