    <abstract>This amendment defines modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 medium access control layer (MAC) and physical layers (PHY). Compared to Std IEEE 802.11-2020 it enables absolute and relative position estimation with higher accuracy, and reduces wireless medium utilization and power consumption, is scalable to dense deployments, and includes security features.</abstract>
