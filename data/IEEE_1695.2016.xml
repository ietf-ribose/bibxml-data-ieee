    <abstract>Voltage conditions that may arise at publicly and privately accessible locations as a result of the delivery and use of electrical energy are addressed in this guide. This guide is not intended for use as a statement of cause and effect. It focuses primarily on the presence of power frequency related voltage conditions and discusses definitions, sources, testing techniques, and strategies that may be available to help reduce those conditions.</abstract>
