abstract:
  content: A security protocol that can be used to protect IEEE 802 Local Area Networks
    (LANs) and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) is described. This Open Systems Interconnection
    (OSI) Layer 2 security protocol can be used to provide the security services of
    confidentiality and connectionless integrity. In conjunction with key management
    or system management, the security services of data origin authentication and
    access control may also be provided.
