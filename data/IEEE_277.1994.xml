    <abstract>Electrical distribution systems in cement plants that would result in satisfactory equipment utilization, reliability, performance, safety, and low maintenance-all at a reasonable cost are recommended in this IEEE standard. Power distribution for a new plant and for a plant extension are covered, as is distribution in quarries. Remarks: Superseded by IEEE Std 277-2007</abstract>
