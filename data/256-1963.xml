    <abstract>This Standard recommends and describes methods of measurement of the important electrical characteristics of semiconductor diodes, For the purpose of this Standard, a semiconductor diode is defined as: "A semiconductor device having two terminals and exhibiting a nonlinear voltage-current characteristic ; in more restricted usage, a semiconductor device which has the asymmetrical voltage-current characteristic exemplified by a single p-n junction." Methods of test are described for static, small-signal and pulse parameters. Many of the terms considered herein have been set down in AIEE and IRE Standards, particularly in 60 IRE 28.S1 and AIEE No. 425.</abstract>
