    <abstract>Control architecture for high-power electronics from power semiconductor device levels to the power system level is defined and characterized. Coverage includes the application of power electronics in the areas of Power Quality/Custom Power, Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS), High Voltage DC Transmission (HVDC), Distributed Generation, Energy Storage applications, etc. with a power range from hundreds of kW to thousands of MW, but with emphasis on the 1 MW to hundreds of MW.</abstract>
