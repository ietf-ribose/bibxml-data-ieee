    <abstract>Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets and headsets. The methods may also be applicable to a wide variety of other communications equipment, including cordless, wireless and mobile communications devices. Measurement results may be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized basis. Application is in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 8500 Hz. This edition incorporates IEEE Std 269a-2007. Other substantive changes have been made since the 2002 edition. This document contains sound files.
