    <abstract>The chief purpose of this test procedure is to classify insulation systems in accordance with their temperature limits by test, rather than by chemical composition. The intention is, first, to classify according to the recognized A, B and H categories, whose usual continuous hot-spot temperatures are 105, 130 and 180C, respectively. Second, to ascertain whether it is appropriate to change the present hot-spot temperatures for certain applications. It is not the intention to use this procedure at present to define any new or intermediate insulation classes.</abstract>
