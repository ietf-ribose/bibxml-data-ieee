    <abstract>This standard establishes a set of ontologies with different abstraction levels that contain concepts, definitions, axioms and use cases which assist in the development of ethically driven methodologies for the design of Robots and Automation Systems. It focuses on the Robotics and Automation domain, without considering any particular application or robot, and can be used in multiple ways, for instance, during the development of Robotics and Automation Systems as a guideline; or as a reference "taxonomy" to enable a clear and precise communication among members from different communities that include Robotics and Automation, Ethics, and correlated areas. Users of this standard need to have a minimal knowledge on formal Logics to understand the axiomatization expressed in Common Logic Interchange Format.
