    <abstract>Expanded explanations, best practices, and guidance for avoiding the pitfalls associated with electrostatic discharge (ESD) testing to IEC and other international ESD standards are provided and should be considered a supplement to these standards, rather than a replacement. Unique ESD test procedures related to connecting charged peripherals to equipment in use are also included. ** Downloads file posted at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/C63/C63.16/.</abstract>
