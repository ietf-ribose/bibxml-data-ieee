abstract:
  content: 'Guidance for synchronization, calibration, testing, and installation of
    phasor measurement units (PMUs) applied in power systems is provided. The following
    are addressed in this guide: (a) Considerations for the installation of PMU devices
    based on application requirements and typical substation electrical bus configurations;
    (b) Techniques focusing on the overall accuracy and availability of the time synchronization
    system; (c) Test and calibration procedures for PMUs for laboratory and field
    applications; (d) Communications testing for connecting PMUs to other devices
    including Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs).'
