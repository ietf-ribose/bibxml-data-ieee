    <abstract>This standard covers electrical characteristics and mechanical features of 3-phase, 60cycle, 2-winding, mineral-oil-immersed indoor transformers rated 250 to 35000 kva, inclusive, high voltage 2400 to 34400 volts, inclusive, used for supplying electric power to direct arc ferrous-melting furnaces. 17-00.012 All characteristics and definitions, except as specifically covered in this standard, shall be in accordance with the American Standard Requirements, Terminology and Test Code for Distribution, Power and Regulating Transformers, and Reactors Other Than Current-Limiting Reactors, C57.12-1958, or the latest revision thereof approved by the American Standards Association, Incorporated. Certain information in the American Standard and in this First Report may eventually be included in sections which will be prepared for general requirements, terminology and test code for arc furnace transformers.</abstract>
