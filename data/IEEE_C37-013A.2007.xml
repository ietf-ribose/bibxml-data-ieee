    <abstract>This amendment includes special requirements better suited for generator circuit breakers used to protect smaller generators rated between 10 MVA and 50 MVA and between 50 MVA and 100 MVA. It is important because the existing standards for typical distribution circuit breakers specifically exclude generator circuit breakers from the scope.</abstract>
