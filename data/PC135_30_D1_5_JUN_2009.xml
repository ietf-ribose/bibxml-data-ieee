    <abstract>This standard provides requirements for materials, test, performance, and manufacture of ground rod electrodes, and threaded and threadless ground rod couplings and clamps commonly used in overhead line construction. It applies to ground rod electrodes and ground rod couplings of copper or steel alloyed materials. Specifically included are ground rod electrodes of copper-coated steel, hot-dip galvanized steel and solid stainless steel for grounding applications.</abstract>
