abstract:
  content: This Guide attempts to assist the power equipment operator in evaluating
    oil received in equipment and as filled at the installation site and to assist
    also in his efforts to maintain his oil in serviceable condition. It recommends
    and standardizes oil test and evaluation procedures, methods of reconditioning
    and reclaiming oil when necessary, and routines for restoring oxidation resistance
    by additions of inhibitors.
