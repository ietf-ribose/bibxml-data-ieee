    <abstract>Millions of IEEE Std 802.15.4g(TM)-2012 based devices are currently operating in Sub-1 GHz frequency bands to provide the low to moderate data rate capabilities. IEEE Std 802.11ah(TM)-2016 may operate in the same Sub-1 GHz frequency bands and provides higher data rate capabilities. This recommended practice enables IEEE Std 802.15.4g and IEEE Std 802.11ah to effectively operate in license exempt Sub-1 GHz frequency bands, by providing best practices and coexistence methods.</abstract>
