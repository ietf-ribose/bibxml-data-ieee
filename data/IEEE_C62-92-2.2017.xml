    <abstract>The basic factors and general considerations in selecting the class and means of neutral grounding for synchronous generator systems connected to electrical utility systems are provided in this guide. It also provides the suggested methods and apparatus to be used to achieve the desired grounding. These guidelines apply to both large and small generators found in electrical utility systems. Definitions of grounding terms used in this the guide can be found in IEEE Std C62.92.1(TM)-2000.</abstract>
