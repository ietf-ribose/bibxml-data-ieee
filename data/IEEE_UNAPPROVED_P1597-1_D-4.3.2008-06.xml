    <abstract>This standard defines a method to validate computational electromagnetics (CEM) computer modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) techniques, codes, and models. It is applicable to a wide variety of electromagnetic (EM) applications including but not limited to the fields of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), radar cross section (RCS), signal integrity (SI), and antennas. Validation of a particular solution data set can be achieved by comparison to the data set obtained by measurements, alternate codes, canonical, or analytic methods.</abstract>
