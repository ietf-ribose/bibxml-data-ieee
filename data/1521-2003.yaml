abstract:
  content: Reaffirmed March 2010. A set of metrics and methods to enable consistent
    measurement of the components of timing interval error in video synchronization
    signals is provided. By partitioning the spectra into regions of jitter and lower
    frequency wander (characterized as frequency offset and drift rate), timing performance
    can be better quantified for consistent control over nontraditional networks.
