    <abstract>A method for computation of an energy efficiency upper bound for an apparatus (wireless or wired) processing a particular communication signal waveform is specified in this standard. This method utilizes the signal envelope probability density function in combination with apparatusâ€™ power dissipation characteristics to calculate the energy efficiency upper bound. The purpose of this standard is to provide a consistent tool to other Working Groups and other practitioners who need to evaluate any communication signal waveforms potential for energy efficiency when implemented in hardware.</abstract>
