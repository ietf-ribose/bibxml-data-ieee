    <abstract>Replaced by ISO/IEC 11073-30200:2004. A connection-oriented transport profile and physical layer suitable for medical device communications in legacy devices is established. Communications services and protocols consis-tent with specifications of the Infrared Data Association are defined. These communication services and protocols are optimized for use in patient-connected bedside medical devices.</abstract>
