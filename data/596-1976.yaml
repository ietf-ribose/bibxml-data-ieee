abstract:
- content: The Dataway defined in IEEE Std 583-1975, Modular Instrumentation and Digital
    Interface System, is the basis for all CAMAC* systems. It provides the means of
    interconnection between modules and a crate controller within one crate. This
    standard defines the CAMAC Parallel Highway Interface System for interconnecting
    up to seven CAMAC crates (or other devices) and a system controller. The Parallel
    Highway, so called because the data bits are transmitted along the Highway in
    parallel, is capable of handling higher data rates than nonparallel highways.
    However, in some applications, for example, where there are long distances between
    crates or where simplicity of interconnections is particularly important, the
    Serial Highway of IEEE Std 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface System (CAMAC),
    may be more suitable.This standard defines the signals, timing, and logical organization
    of the connections from crate controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers to the
    Parallel Highway through a standard connector. The internal structures of crate
    controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers, and the physical construction of the
    Parallel Highway System are defined only where they affect compatibility between
    parts of the system.

- content: The interface system on which this standard is based was developed by the
    ESONE Committee of European Laboratories with the collaboration of the NIM Committee
    of the U. S. Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). This standard
    is supplementary to IEEE Std 583-1975 Modular Instrumentation and Digital Interface
    System (CAMAC), and is based on ERDA Reports TID-25876, March 1972 (corresponding
    to ESONE Report EUR 4600e) and TID-25877. The mandatory features in this standard
    are identical to those in the proceeding reports and in the corresponding publication
    of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) that is currently being
    processed. A serial highway interface system, also intended for use with IEEE
    Std 583-1975, is defined in IEEE Std 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface System.
