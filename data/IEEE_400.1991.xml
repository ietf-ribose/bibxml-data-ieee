    <abstract>Superseded by 400-2001. Procedures and recommended test voltage values for acceptance and maintenance high-direct-voltage testing of shielded power cable systems are set forth. They apply to all types of shielded, insulated power cable. The aim is to provide uniform test procedures and guidelines for evaluation of the test results. This guide is not intended to apply to unshielded power cables, communication cables, control cables, high-frequency cables, or other special-purpose cables, nor does it purport to require that testing be performed, either at the time of installation or maintenance.</abstract>
