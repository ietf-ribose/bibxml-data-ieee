    <abstract>Induced voltage working procedures for underground transmission circuits are established in this guide. A transmission circuit when de-energized will have an induced voltage when in a common duct bank with an energized circuit. The induced voltage may be a possible safety hazard. The induced voltage may be determined by modeling the circuits and by measurement. This guide addresses the working procedures to follow when performing work where induced voltage is present.</abstract>
