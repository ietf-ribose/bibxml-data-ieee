    <abstract>This standard describes qualification methods for Class 1E vented lead acid batteries and racks to be used in nuclear power generating stations outside primary containment. Qualification required by IEEE Std 308 can be demonstrated by using the procedures in this standard in accordance with IEEE Std 323. Application of batteries in Nuclear Power Generating Stations can be divided into two sections; duty cycles equal to or less than 8 hours and duty cycles greater than hours. This standard provides a process to demonstrate qualification for both applications.</abstract>
