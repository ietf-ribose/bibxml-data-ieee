    <abstract>The material presented in this standard is intended to provide common terminology and test methods for the testing and evaluation of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This standard considers only those ADCs whose output values have discrete values at discrete times, i.e. they are quantized and sampled.</abstract>
