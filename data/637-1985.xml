    <abstract>Detailed procedures are provided for reclaiming used mineral insulating oils (transformer oils) by chemical and mechanical means to make them suitable for reuse as insulating fluids. Reclamation procedures are described, as are the test methods used to evaluate the progress and end point of the reclamation process and the essential properties required for reuse in each class of equipment. Suitable criteria for the use of reclaimed oils are identified. The use of oil in new apparatus under warranty is not covered.</abstract>
