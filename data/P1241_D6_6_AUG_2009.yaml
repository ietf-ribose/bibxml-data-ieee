abstract:
  content: The material presented in this standard is intended to provide common terminology
    and test methods for the testing and evaluation of analog-to-digital converters
    (ADCs). This standard considers only those ADCs whose output values have discrete
    values at discrete times, i.e. they are quantized and sampled. In general, this
    quantization is assumed to be nominally uniform (the input-output transfer curve
    is approximately a straight line) as discussed further in clause 1.3, and the
    sampling is assumed to be at a nominally uniform rate. Some but not all of the
    test methods in this standard can be used for ADCs that are designed for non-uniform
    quantization.
