    <abstract>Formal models for information used in system diagnosis are defined. As part of the AI-ESTATE set of standards, this standard includes several models that form the basis for a format to facilitate exchange of persistent diagnostic information between two reasoners, and also provides a formal typing system for the services defined in the AI-ESTATE service specification.</abstract>
