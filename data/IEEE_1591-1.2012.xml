    <abstract>Hardware performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria for a transmission line overhead ground wire (also known as shield wire, static wire, earth wire, sky wire) with optical fibers commonly known as optical ground wire (OPGW) are covered. Functional requirements, such as electrical, mechanical, optical fiber, environmental, and test requirements related to design, installation, in service, and maintenance, including routine tests, are included.</abstract>
