    <abstract>This guide presents practical line current differential schemes using digital communication. Operating principles, synchronization methods, channel requirements, current transformer requirements, external time reference requirements, backup considerations, testing considerations and troubleshooting are included. It also provides specific guidelines for various application aspects including multi-terminal lines, series compensated lines, mutual coupled lines, line charging current, in-zone transformers and reactors, single-pole tripping and reclosing as well as channel and external time sources requirements.</abstract>
