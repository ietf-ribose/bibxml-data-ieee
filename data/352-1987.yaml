abstract:
  content: The basic principles that are needed to conduct a reliability analysis
    of safety systems are provided for designers and operators of nuclear power plant
    safety systems and the concerned regulatory groups. By applying the principles
    given, systems may be analyzed, results may be compared with reliability objectives,
    and the basis for decisions may be suitably documented. The quantitative principles
    are applicable to the analysis of the effects of component failures on safety
    system reliability. Although they have their greatest value during the design
    phase, the principles are applicable during any phase of the system s lifetime.
    They may also be applied during the preoperational phase or at any time during
    the normal lifetime of a system.
