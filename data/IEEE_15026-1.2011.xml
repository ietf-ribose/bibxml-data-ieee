    <abstract>This trial-use standard adopts ISO/IEC TR 15026-1:2010, which defines terms and establishes an extensive and organized set of concepts and their relationships for software and systems assurance, thereby establishing a basis for shared understanding of the concepts and principles central to ISO/I EC 15026 across its user communities. It provides information to users of the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 15026, including the use of each part and the combined use of multiple parts. Coverage of assurance for a service being operated and managed on an ongoing basis is not covered in ISO/I EC 15026.</abstract>
