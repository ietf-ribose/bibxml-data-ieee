    <abstract>The characteristics and classification of current transformers (cts) used for protective relaying are described. This guide also describes the conditions that cause the ct output to be distorted and the effects on relaying systems of this distortion. The selection and application of cts for the more common protection schemes are also addressed.</abstract>
