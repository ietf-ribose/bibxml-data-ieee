abstract:
  content: Data messages, known as Protocol Data Units (PDUs), that are exchanged
    on a network among simulation applications are defined. These PDUs are for interactions
    that take place within specified domains called protocol families, which include
    Entity Information/Interaction, Warfare, Logistics, Simulation Management, Distributed
    Emission Regeneration,Radio Communications, Entity Management, Minefield, Synthetic
    Environment, Simulation Management with Reliability, Information Operations, Live
    Entity Information/Interaction, and Non-Real-Time protocol.
