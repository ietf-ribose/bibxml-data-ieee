    <abstract>IEEE Std 421.2-1990, IEEE Guide for Identification, Testing, and Evaluation of the Dynamic Performance of Excitation Control Systems, presents dynamic performance criteria, definitions, and test objectives for excitation control systems as applied by electric utilities. It should be specifically noted that the term “excitation control system” refers to the entire control system including the synchronous machine and power system as well as the excitation system.</abstract>
