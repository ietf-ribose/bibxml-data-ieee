    <abstract>The scope of this guide is to define and characterize control architecture for high-power electronics from power semiconductor device levels to the power system level. This guide covers theapplication of power electronics in the areas of Power Quality/Custom Power, Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS), High Voltage DC Transmission (HVDC), Distributed Generation, Energy Storage applications, etc. with a power range from hundreds of kW to thousands of MW, but with emphasis on the 1 MW to hundreds of MW.</abstract>
