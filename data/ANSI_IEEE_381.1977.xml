    <abstract>Minimum requirements for, and guidance regarding, the methods and procedures for qualification of power-driven valve actuators with safety-related functions are established. The qualification of all types of power-driven valve actuators, including damper actuators, is covered. The standard qualification cases and their environmental parameters for the usual locations of safety-related equipment in a nuclear generating station are described. Test procedures are presented.</abstract>
