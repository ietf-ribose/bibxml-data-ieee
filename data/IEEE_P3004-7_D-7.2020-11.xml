    <abstract>The protection of power cables used in industrial and commercial power systems is covered in this recommended practice. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience in the area of protection and control. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.</abstract>
