    <abstract>Many commercial software products and academic research projects continue to use analysis methods appropriate for transmission systems, but not for distribution systems. Many research papers submitted for publication still address questions that have been well-settled by previous work. The purpose of this Recommended Practice is to focus research attention on areas where legitimate needs exist, and to identify methods that should not be used in software products.</abstract>
