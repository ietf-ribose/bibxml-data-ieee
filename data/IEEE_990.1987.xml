    <abstract>Withdrawn Standard -- Recommendations reflecting the state of the art and alternate approaches to good practice for establishing characteristics of program design languages (PDLs) based on the syntax and semantics of the Ada programming language are provided. Capabilities for general methodology support, specific design support, and product and management information support, as well as the relationship of the PDL to Ada, are covered. The use of an Ada PDL is not covered.</abstract>
