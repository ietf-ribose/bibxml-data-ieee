    <abstract>This recommended practice provides a standardized body of theory, techniques, and procedures for measuring the spectral characteristics of 8-VSB transmitters used for terrestrial transmission of digital television (DTV) in the frequency range near their assigned channels. Essential characteristics are specified and measurement procedures are given that ensure that all parties will obtain comparable results.</abstract>
