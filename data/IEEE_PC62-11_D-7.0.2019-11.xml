    <abstract>Metal-oxide surge arresters (MOSAs) designed to repeatedly limit the voltage surges on 48 Hz to 62 Hz power circuits (&gt;1000 V) by passing surge discharge current and automatically limiting the flow of system power current are addressed in this standard. This standard applies to devices for separate mounting and to devices supplied integrally with other equipment. The tests demonstrate that an arrester is able to survive the rigors of reasonable environmental conditions and system phenomena while protecting equipment and/or the system from damaging overvoltages caused by lightning, switching, and other undesirable surges.</abstract>
