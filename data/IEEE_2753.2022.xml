    <abstract>This guide provides comprehensive test methods for the pantograph off-line and the reasonable evaluation for the performance of current collection system in high-speed railway. Model for the arcing erosion, as well as the off-line induced transient overvoltage and harmonics, which impact the onsite devicesâ€™ safety are included.</abstract>
