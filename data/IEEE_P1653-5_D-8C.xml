    <abstract>Design, manufacturing, and testing unique to the application of thyristor controlled power rectifiers for dc supplied transportation substation applications up to 1500 V dc nominal output is covered in this recommended practice. Both forward rectifier with power flow from ac to dc, and reversible rectifiers with bidirectional power flow are included; traction power substation rectifiers that are to be provided as part of a rectifier transformer unit or are provided separately are intended to be addressed. Application information and extensive definitions of related technical terms are included.</abstract>
