    <abstract>The neutral grounding of single and three-phase ac electric utility primary distribution systems with nominal voltages in the range of 2.4 kV34.5 kV is addressed. Classes of distribution systems grounding are defined. Basic considerations in distribution system grounding concerning economics, control of temporary over voltages, control of ground-fault currents, and ground relaying are addressed. Also considered is the use of grounding transformers, grounding of high voltage neutral of wye-delta distribution transformers, and interconnection of primary and secondary neutrals of distribution transformers.</abstract>
