  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">Software Reliability (SR) models have been evaluated &amp;amp; ranked for their applicability to various situations. The revision will reflect advances in SR since 1992, including modeling &amp;amp; prediction for distributed &amp;amp; network systems. Situation specific usage guidance will be refined &amp;amp; updated. The included methodology tools will be extended over the software life cycle.</abstract>
