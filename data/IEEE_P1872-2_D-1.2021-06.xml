    <abstract>This standard extends IEEE 1872-2015 Standard for Ontologies for Robotics and Automation to represent additional domain-specific concepts, definitions, and axioms commonly used in Autonomous Robotics (AuR). This standard is general and can be used in many ways - for example, to specify the domain knowledge needed to unambiguously describe the design patterns of AuR systems, to represent AuR system architectures in a unified way, or as a guideline to build autonomous systems consisting of robots operating in various environments.</abstract>
