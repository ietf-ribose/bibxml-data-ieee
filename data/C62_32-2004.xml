    <abstract>This standard applies to air gaps for overvoltage protection applications on systems with operating voltages equal to or less than 600 V rms. This standard contains a series of standard tests for determining the electrical characteristics of these air gap devices. This standard's test criteria and definitions provide a common engineering language beneficial to users and manufacturers of air gap surge protective devices.</abstract>
