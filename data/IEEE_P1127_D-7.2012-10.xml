    <abstract>Significant community acceptance and environmental compatibility items to be considered during the planning and design phases, the construction period, and the operation of electric supply substations are identified, and ways to address these concerns to obtain community acceptance and environmental compatibility are documented. On-site generation and telecommunication facilities are not considered.</abstract>
