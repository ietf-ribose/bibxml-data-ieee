    <abstract>Information that is useful in constructing test sites used to perform radiated emission measurements in the frequency range of 30 MHz to 18 GHz is provided. Final validity of a test site can only be determined by performing normalized site attenuation and/or site voltage standing-wave ratio measurements as described in ANSI C63.4.</abstract>
