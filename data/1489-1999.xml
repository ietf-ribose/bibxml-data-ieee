    <abstract>The expanding use of digital communications among subsystems of the transportation infrastructure has spawned the development of data dictionaries for the communications between these subsystems. A format for intelligent transportation system (ITS) data dictionaries, including common terms (e.g. time, date, location), as well as the meta-attributes necessary to document ITS data concepts, is addressed in this standard.</abstract>
