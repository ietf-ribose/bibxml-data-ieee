    <abstract>An approach to preparing a specification for the thyristor bypass switch (TBS) of a unified power flow controller (UPFC) using modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology is documented by this guide. The intention of this guide is to serve as a base specification to allow users to modify or develop specific clauses to meet a particular application.</abstract>
