    <abstract>The scope of this recommended practice is the performance of surge testing on electrical and electronic equipment connected to low-voltage ac power circuits, specifically using the recommended test waveforms defined in IEEE Std C62.41.2 -2002. Nevertheless, these recommendations are applicable to any surge testing, regardless of the specific surges that may be applied.</abstract>
