    <abstract>This standard is intended to be a basic or primary document that can be utilized and referenced by owners of ac motors and generators (machines) that need refurbishment, repair, and/or rewinding, as well as service or repair facilities. It has been developed for the petroleum, chemical, and process industries, and it may be adapted to other areas of interest. The use of this standard is expected to result in higher quality and more cost effective, timely repairs. A means of evaluating work performed and repair or service facilities is also provided.</abstract>
