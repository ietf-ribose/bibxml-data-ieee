    <abstract>Defined in this standard is the general process of cryptocurrency payment between consumers and merchants. This process describes how a consumer purchases goods or services with cryptocurrency and how the merchant receives fiat money in return. It involves multiple aspects such as cryptocurrency payment operators playing an agent role, consumers owning cryptocurrency, merchant accessing to a cryptocurrency payment platform, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges.</abstract>
