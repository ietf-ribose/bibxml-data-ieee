    <abstract>This recommended practice provides guidance for the installation and installation design of valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries. This recommended practice is intended for all standby stationary installations. However, specific applications, such as emergency lighting units and semi-portable equipment, may have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Alternative energy applications are not covered.</abstract>
