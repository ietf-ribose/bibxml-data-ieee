    <abstract>This standard specifies the protocol, data encapsulations, connection management and presentation time procedures used to ensure interoperability between audio and video based end stations that use standard networking services provided by all IEEE 802 networks meeting QoS requirements for time-sensitive applications by leveraging the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) family of protocols and IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocols.</abstract>
