abstract:
  content: This International Standard deals with the evaluation and selection of
    CASE tools, covering a partial or full portion of the software engineering life
    cycle. It establishes processes and activities to be applied for the evaluation
    of CASE tools and selecting the most appropriate CASE tools from several candidates.
    These processes are generic, and organisations must tailor them to meet organisational
    needs. The CASE tool evaluation and selection processes should be viewed in the
    larger context of the organisation's technology adoption process.
