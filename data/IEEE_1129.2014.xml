    <abstract>The guidelines for online monitoring of large synchronous generators are described in this guide. High-level discussions of each of the proposed monitoring methods, and recommended threshold values, whenever there is a general agreement on those values, are included in this standard. Instrumentation that is clearly understood to belong to the protection scheme of the generator (e.g., differential protection) is not covered by this guide.</abstract>
