    <abstract>This standard sets forth the requirements for a calibration program to control and verify the accuracy of M&amp;TE (measuring and test equipment) which is used to assure that important parts of nuclear power generating stations are in conformance with prescribed technical requirements, and that data provided by testing, inspection, or maintenance are valid. These important parts include those structures, systems, and components whose satisfactory performance is required; for the plant to operate safely, to prevent accidents that could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public, or to mitigate the consequences of such accidents if they were to occur. This standard is intended to be used in conjunction with American National Standard Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Power Plants, ANSI N45.2-1971.</abstract>
