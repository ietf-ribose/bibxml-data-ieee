abstract:
- content: This standard covers all relays directly associated with electric power
    apparatus. However, it relates only to relays of types directly associated with
    power switchgear. It does not cover relays of types designed primarily for industrial
    control, excitation, or governor regulating, telephone, telegraph, traffic signal,
    or similar purpose.

- content: The standard in this publication is the first revision of the American
    Standard for Relays Associated with Power Switchgear, C37.1-1937. A proposed revision,
    dated January 12, 1949, was prepared by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers
    Relay Committee and then submitted to the American Standards Association, Incorporated.
    Subsequent work on the proposed standard was carried on by the Sectional Committee
    on Power Switchgear, C37.The standard relates only to relays of types directly
    associated with power switchgear. It does notcover relays of types designed primarily
    for industrial control, excitation, or governor regulating, telephone, telegraph,
    traffic signal, or similar purpose.
