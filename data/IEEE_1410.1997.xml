    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE 1410-2004. This guide will identify factors that contribute to lightning-caused faults on overhead distribution lines and suggest improvements to existing and new constructions. This guide is limited to the protection of distribution-line insulation for system voltages 69 kV and below. Equipment protection considerations are covered in IEEE Std C62.22-1991.</abstract>
