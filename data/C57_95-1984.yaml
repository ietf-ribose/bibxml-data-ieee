abstract:
  content: This guide covers general recommendations for loading mineral oil-immersed,
    55 degrees C rise, step-voltage and induction-voltage regulators manufactured
    in accordance with ANSI/IEEE C57.15-1986. Some users may choose to load regulators
    as though rated for 65 degrees C rise, although this operation is not recognized
    by ANSI/IEEE C57.15-1986. This guide treats the loss of life to be anticipated
    under such operation. Loading recommendations in tabular form are contained in
    this guide. These recommendations cover a wide range of ambient conditions and
    loss of life. The method and equations used for calculation of the tables are
    given. This guide is only applicable for regulators having inherent capability
    to permit the loadings covered.<<ETX>>
