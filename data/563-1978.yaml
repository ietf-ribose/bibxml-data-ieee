abstract:
  content: With the increasing interest and concern regarding the vibration of overhead
    conductors, and the emphasis on the improvement of existing methods and the development
    of new techniques for controlling the problem, there is a growing requirement
    for reliable information on the self-damping characteristics of conductors. This
    parameter is a principal factor in determining the response of conductors to alternating
    forces, such as arise from wind flow over conductors. This guideline has been
    prepared for the purpose of encouraging investigators contemplating making measurements
    of the inherent damping characteristics of conductors, to adopt the methods outlined.
    It is anticipated that the resulting information, being in a compatible and consistent
    form, will provide a reliable basis for studying the vibration and damping of
    conductors in the future and for the comparison of data of various investigators.<<ETX>>
