    <abstract>General recommendations for loading mineral-oil-immersed power transformers and other oil-insulated power transformer having up to and including 100 MVA maximum nameplate rating are covered. They are based mostly on aging of the winding insulation. This guide may also be used for askarel-filled transformers. The method used for computer calculation of the capability tables for normal and moderate sacrifice of life and examples for developing them by hand calculations are given.</abstract>
