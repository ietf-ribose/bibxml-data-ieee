- content: This standard defines the preferred ratings for low-voltage ac (635 V and
    below) power circuit breakers, general purpose dc (325 V and below) power circuit
    breakers, heavy duty low- voltage dc (3200 V and below) power circuit breakers,
    and fused (integrally or non-integrally) low- voltage ac (600 V and below) power
    circuit breakers.
