  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">These Marine Recommendations have been drawn up to serve as a guide for the equipment of merchant vessels with an electric plant system and electric apparatus for lighting, signaling, communication, power, and propulsion. They indicate what is considered good engineering practice with reference to safety of the personnel and of the ship itself as well as reliability and durability of the apparatus; it is not intended, however, that improvements, which may be developed from time to time, should be excluded. These Recommendations are intended to supplement the other Standards of the IEEE, which should be followed wherever applicable. Attention is directed to the fact that regulations for electric installations on shipboard are promulgated by the Government Regulatory Agencies and the American Bureau of Shipping. These Recommendations have given due consideration to all the regulations, but since the above referenced sponsoring bodies frequently modify the requirements to meet changing conditions, reference should always be made to the latest edition of their requirements.</abstract>
