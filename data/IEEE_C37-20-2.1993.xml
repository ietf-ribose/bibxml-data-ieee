    <abstract>Metal-enclosed medium voltage switchgear (ME), which can contain either drawout electrically operated circuit breakers or stationary electrically operated circuit breakers in individual three-pole grounded metal compartments, is covered. Further, metal-clad switchgear (MC) is compartmentalized to isolate all components such as instrumentation, main bus, and both incoming and outgoing connections with grounded metal barriers. Rated maximum voltage levels for metal-clad switchgear (MC) range from 5 kV through 38 kV with main bus continuous current ratings of 1200 A, 2000 A, and 3000 A. Rated maximum voltage levels for station-type cubicle switchgear (SC) range from 15.5 kV through 72.5 kV with main bus continuous current ratings of 2000 A, 3000 A, 4000 A, and 5000 A. ME switchgear also contains associated control, instruments, metering, relaying, protective, and regulating devices as necessary. Service conditions, ratings, temperature limitations, and classification of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application are discussed.</abstract>
