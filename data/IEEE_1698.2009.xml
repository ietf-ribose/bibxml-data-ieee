    <abstract>The design of automatic train protection and signal systems for fixed guideway (e.g., rail) transit systems requires knowledge of the braking distance of the vehicles utilized on the systems. Methods and assumptions used in calculating the braking distances of rail transit vehicles are provided in this guide. The methods encompass automatic train protection and signal system operation, propulsion and brake system operation, environmental conditions, operator interfaces, tolerances, and failure modes.</abstract>
