    <abstract>Promoting and facilitating interoperability components of automatic test systems where actions taken during maintenance need to be shared is addressed in this standard. The standard thus facilitates the capture of maintenance action information data in storage devices and databases, facilitating online and offline analysis. The maintenance action information schema becomes a class of information that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards. The exchange format is expressed in both the OWL and XML formats.</abstract>
