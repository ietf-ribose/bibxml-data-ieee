abstract:
  content: IEEE Std 500-1984 represents the most comprehensive and up-to-date collection
    of reliability data in the world. Data have been culled from the broad, even widening
    sphere of disciplines where reliability technology has been applied to the solution
    of problems. The document is applicable to all segments of the power industry.
    Numerous other large industries such as steel-making, chemical production, marine
    transportation, and refining will find the manual an invaluable source of reliability
    information. The reliability data presented includes failure rate ranges, failure
    modes, and environmental factor information on generic components actually or
    potentially in use in nuclear power generating stations.<<ETX>>
