    <abstract>A set of standard verification tasks for processor-based equipment used in safety-critical applications on rail and transit systems is covered. This standard also covers processes that verify the level of safety achieved in the implementation of safety-critical functions that are required to be fail-safe. Quality assurance or validation processes that affect the overall level of system safety are not covered.</abstract>
