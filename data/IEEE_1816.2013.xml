    <abstract>Accepted best industry practices for the preparation of extruded dielectric shielded medium voltage cables rated 2.5 kV through 46 kV for the installation of mating accessories are defined in this guide. The information is intended to supplement cable accessory manufacturer installation instructions. The guide aims to provide a single source covering the proper methods to prepare cables for termination and jointing to maximize long-term, reliable operation of electrical power cable systems.</abstract>
