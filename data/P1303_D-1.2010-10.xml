    <abstract>General guidelines and criteria for the field testing of static var compensators (SVCs), before they are placed in-service, for the purpose of verifying their specified performance are described. The major elements of a commissioning program are identified so that the user can formulate a specific plan that is most suited for his or her own SVC.</abstract>
