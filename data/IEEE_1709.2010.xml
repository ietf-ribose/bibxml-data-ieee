    <abstract>Guidelines to specify, procure, design, manufacture and develop manuals, safety procedures, practices and procedures for effective maintenance of medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) electrical power systems is discussed in this recommended practice. Recommendations are made for analytical methods, preferred interconnection interfaces and performance characteristics for reliable integration of MVDC electrical components into the ship MVDC electrical power systems.</abstract>
