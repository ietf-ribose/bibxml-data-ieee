    <abstract>Information for selecting the proper circuit breaker for a particular application is provided. Application engineers are aided in specifying the type of circuit breaker, ratings, trip functions, and accessories. Circuit breakers for special applications, e.g., instantaneous only and switches are discussed. In addition, information for applying circuit breakers at different locations in the power system and for protecting specific components is provided.</abstract>
