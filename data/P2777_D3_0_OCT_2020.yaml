abstract:
  content: General technical recommended practice for operation of pulverized coal-fired
    boilers in power plants is provided, including start-up, shutdown, operation and
    maintenance, and emergency and failure detection/handling/prevention. In this
    document, a boiler with existing single units with a capacity of 300 MW to 600
    MW in thermal power plants, where pulverized coal is combusted to generate electricity
    and/or to supply heat, is discussed. Development of boiler operation code as a
    reference to determine detailed operation steps and/or procedures for a particular
    boiler in the plant is outlined. The specifications of manufacturers, successful
    experiences from practice, and stipulations defined in other related high-level
    standards/regulations/codes are also considered.
