abstract:
  content: Minimum functional and design criteria for the power, instrumentation,
    and control portions of nuclear power generating station safety systems are established.
    The criteria are to be applied to those systems required to protect the public
    health and safety by functioning to mitigate the consequences of design basis
    events. The intent is to promote appropriate practices for design and evaluation
    of safety system performance and reliability. Although the standard is limited
    to safety systems, many of the principles may have applicability to equipment
    provided for safe shutdown, post-accident monitoring display instrumentation,
    interlock features, or any other systems, structures, or equipment related to
    safety.
