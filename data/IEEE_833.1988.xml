    <abstract>Superseded. This document recommends methods and design features that, if implemented, would provide water-hazard protection to class 1E and non-class 1E systems and equipment from direct sources of water (for example, water spray from decontamination activities) and indirect sources of water (for example, water running along cables and raceways). It is not the purpose of this recommended practice to classify water-hazard protection features as nuclear safety related or non-nuclear safety related. This determination is application specific and is made by the user utilizing the specific nuclear generating station design basis and guidance from other standards.</abstract>
