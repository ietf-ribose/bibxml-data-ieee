abstract:
  content: This standard prescribes the requirements for the design, construction,
    test, and installation of electric penetration assemblies in nuclear containment
    structures for stationary nuclear power generating stations. The requirements
    for external circuits which connect to penetration assemblies are beyond the scope
    of this standard.
