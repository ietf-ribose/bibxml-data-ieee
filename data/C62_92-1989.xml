    <abstract>This report summarizes with general considerations in grounding synchronous generator systems and discusses the factors to be considered in the selection of a grounding class and the application of grounding methods. The guidelines apply to both the large and small generators found in electric utility systems. It should be borne in mind by the user that this report is intended solely as a guide. Statements are necessarily of a general nature and, therefore, do not take into account the requirements of special situations that can differ considerably from those discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
