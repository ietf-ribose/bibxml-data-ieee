    <abstract>This standard sets forth the minimum acceptable requirements for the performance of reliability analyses for safety systems when used to address the reliability considerations discussed in industry standards and guidelines. The methods of this standard may also be applied to other systems, including the interactions, if any, between safety and non-safety systems. The requirements should be applied during the phases of design, fabrication, testing, maintenance, and repair of systems and components in nuclear power generating stations. The timing of the analysis depends upon the purpose for which the analysis is performed. This standard applies to the facility owner and other organizations responsible for the activities previously stated.</abstract>
