abstract:
  content: Uniform methods of measurement of radio noise emitted from low-voltage
    electrical and electronic equipment, including digital and other information technology
    equipment, in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz are set forth. Both unintentional
    and certain intentional radiators are included. Methods for the measurement of
    radiated and powerline conducted radio noise are covered and may be applied to
    any such equipment unless otherwise specified by individual equipment requirements.
