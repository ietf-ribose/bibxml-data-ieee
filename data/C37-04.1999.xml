    <abstract>This standard covers the rating structure for all high-voltage circuit breakers, which include all voltage ratings above 1000 V ac and comprise both indoor and outdoor types having the preferred ratings as listed in ANSI C37.06-1997. Typical circuit breakers covered by these standards have maximum voltage ratings ranging from 4.76 kV through 800 kV, and continuous current ratings of 600 A,1200 A, 2000 A, and 3000 A associated with the various maximum voltage ratings. The rating structure establishes the basis for all assigned ratings, including continuous current, dielectric withstand voltages,short-circuit current, transient recovery voltage, and capacitor switching, plus associated capabilities such as mechanical endurance, load current, and out-of-phase switching. This standard does not cover generator circuit breakers, which are covered in IEEE Std C37.013-1997.</abstract>
