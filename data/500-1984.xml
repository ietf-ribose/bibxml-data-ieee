    <abstract>IEEE Std 500-1984 represents the most comprehensive and up-to-date collection of reliability data in the world. Data have been culled from the broad, even widening sphere of disciplines where reliability technology has been applied to the solution of problems. The document is applicable to all segments of the power industry. Numerous other large industries such as steel-making, chemical production, marine transportation, and refining will find the manual an invaluable source of reliability information. The reliability data presented includes failure rate ranges, failure modes, and environmental factor information on generic components actually or potentially in use in nuclear power generating stations.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
