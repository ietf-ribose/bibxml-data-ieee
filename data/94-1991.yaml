abstract:
  content: The need for standard terminology in the field of automatic generation
    control (AGC) became apparent when it was noted that authors of technical papers
    covering this technology frequently used different terms to convey identical meanings.
    This inconsistency of terms and requests for standardization from operating organizations
    of interconnected power systems in both the United States and Canada led to the
    original development of these definitions. This publication is the second revision
    of these terms. It illustrates the continuing need to standardize commonly used
    terminology unique to AGC. In addition, term definitions are intended principally
    as references, not as tutorial substitutes for training in this control field.
    The definitions provide simplified, unambiguous meanings for individuals having
    a basic understanding of AGC technology.<<ETX>>
