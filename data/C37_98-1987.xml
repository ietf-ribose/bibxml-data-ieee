    <abstract>This standard specifies the procedures to be used in the seismic testing of relays used in power system facilities. It is concerned with the determination of the seismic fragility level of relays and also gives recommendations for proof testing. The purpose is to establish procedures for determining the seismic capabilities of protective and auxiliary relays. These procedures employ what has been called fragility testing IEEE Std 344-1987.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
