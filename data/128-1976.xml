    <abstract>This document provides in compact form recommendations and technical reasons for the selection, design and application of aircraft electric power systems and electrically-actuated load equipment, without going into specific detailed designs. The standard was originally published in 1960 as AIEE 750. Sections of this guide are: introduction; criteria for the electric system; characteristics of alternating-current generators affecting their application; distribution system design; symmetrical components; principal subdivisions of electric system; selection of the system; installation practices; equipment characteristics; and electric system design procedures.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
