abstract:
- content: A common framework for describing the life cycle of systems created by
    humans is established by this standard. It defines a set of processes and associated
    terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a
    system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout
    the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle.
    This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties, with the
    ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction.

- content: This International Standard establishes a common process framework for
    describing the life cycle of man-made systems. It defines a set of processes and
    associated terminology for the full life cycle, including conception, development,
    production, utilization, support and retirement. This standard also supports the
    definition, control, assessment, and improvement of these processes. These processes
    can be applied concurrently, iteratively, and recursively to a system and its
    elements throughout the life cycle of a system.
