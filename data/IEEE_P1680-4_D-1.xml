    <abstract>This standard defines environmental performance criteria for computer servers as defined in the Energy Star Server specifications1, including managed servers and blade servers. This standard establishes criteria for multiple levels of environmental leadership and performance throughout the product life cycle, relating to reduction or elimination of environmentally sensitive materials, materials selection, design for end of life, lifecycle extension, energy conservation, end of life management, corporate responsibility, and packaging</abstract>
