abstract:
  content: Reaffirmed March 2012. This guide is intended for the hydroelectric power
    industry to assist hydroelectric power plant owners, operators, and designers
    in the economic (feasibility) and technical evaluation (electrical aspects) of
    existing hydroelectric installations for rehabilitation. It addresses conventional
    hydropower. Portions of this guide are relevant to pumped storage but the unique
    features of pumped storage are not covered. Feasibility study results may indicate
    redevelopment of the site. Redevelopment will not be treated in detail in this
    guide. This guide covers all generating equipment up to and including the main
    transformer and typical auxiliary equipment.
