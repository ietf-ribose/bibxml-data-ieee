    <abstract>This guide applies to the use of 50 Hz and 60 Hz shunt power capacitors rated 2400 Vac and above, and assemblies of such capacitors. Included are guidelines for the application, protection, and ratings of equipment for the improved safety and reliability in the utilization of shunt power capacitors. The guide is general and intended to be basic and supplemental to specific recommendations of the manufacturer. The guide covers applications that range from simple capacitor unit utilization to complex capacitor bank situations.</abstract>
