abstract:
  content: Superseded by IEEE Std 334-2006 Methods and requirements for qualifying
    continuous duty Class 1E motors for use in nuclear power generating stations are
    provided. The methods are used for qualifying motors, extending the qualification,
    and updating the qualification if the motor's design or specified service conditions
    are modified. The requirements include the principles, procedures, and methods
    of qualification as they relate to continuous duty Class 1E polyphase squirrel
    cage ac motors.
