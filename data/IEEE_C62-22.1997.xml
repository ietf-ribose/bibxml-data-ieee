    <abstract>The application of metal-oxide surge arresters to safeguard electric power equipment against the hazards of abnormally high voltage surges of various origins is covered. Step-by- step directions toward proper solutions of various applications are provided. In many cases, the prescribed steps are adequate. More complex and special solutions requiring study by experi- enced engineers are described, but specific solutions are not always given. The procedures are based on theoretical studies, test results, and experience.</abstract>
