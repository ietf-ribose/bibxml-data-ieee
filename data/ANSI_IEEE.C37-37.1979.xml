    <abstract>Superseded The concepts of allowable continuous current, allowable continuous current class, and loadability factors are used to establish the criteria for designating the load-current carrying capabilities of air switches over a range of ambient temperatures. This is accomplished through a family of loadability factor curves. The loadability factors are also presented in tabular form.</abstract>
