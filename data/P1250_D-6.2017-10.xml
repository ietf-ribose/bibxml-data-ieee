    <abstract>The use of some electrical equipment attached to typical power systems creates power quality concerns. There is an increasing awareness that some equipment is not designed to withstand the surges, faults, distortion, and reclosing duty present on typical utility distribution systems. Traditional concerns about steady-state voltage levels and light flicker due to voltage fluctuation also remain. These concerns are addressed by this guide by documenting typical levels of these aspects of power quality and indicating how to improve them. Other documents that treat these subjects in more detail are referenced.</abstract>
