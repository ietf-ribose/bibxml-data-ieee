    <abstract>Electrical, dimensional, and mechanical charasteristics and certain safety features of single-phase, 60Hz, liquid-immersed, self cooled, submersible distribution transformers are covered. This standard is intended for use as a basis for establishing the performance, electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and safety of the equipment covered, and to assist in the proper selection of such equipment.</abstract>
