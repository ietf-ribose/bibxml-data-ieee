    <abstract>Elements of a radio frequency (RF) exposure safety program that can prevent or control potential risks associated with exposure to the electromagnetic fields from RF sources that operate in the frequency range of 3kHz to 300 GHz are described in this recommended practice. The means for accomplishing this are classifying exposure locations into one of four categories based on the potential hazard, as defined by exposure limits, and specifying appropriate controls for each category. Such controls include engineering and administrative controls as well as the use of personal protective equipment, placement of appropriate RF safety signage, designation of restricted access areas, the use of personal RF monitors, and RF safety awareness training. These recommendations are not intended to apply to the purposeful exposure of patients by or under the direction of medical practitioners, but can be used in the development of safety programs for medical staff and other persons working with or incidentally exposed to RF fields, and for those wearing implanted or external medical electronic devices. Although designed to complement IEEE Std C95.1, this recommended practice may also be used for the development of programs to insure conformance with IEEE Std C95.6 and with other guidelines, standards, or regulations for controlling human exposure to electromagnetic energy.</abstract>
