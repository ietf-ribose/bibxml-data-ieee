    <abstract>Guidelines under which data sheets for new semiconductor memories are to be generated are provided. Adherence to these guidelines is intended to produce data sheets that are concise and that consistently define the operation and characteristics of semiconductor memory devices. Terminology relevant to product description, product specification, and user information is covered.</abstract>
