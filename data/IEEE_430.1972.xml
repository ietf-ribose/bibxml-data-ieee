    <abstract>The purpose of this standard is to establish uniform procedures for the measurement of radiation of radio noise from overhead power lines with meters that conform to American National Standards. A uniform procedure is a prerequisite to comparisons of radio-noise performance of various overhead power lines. The procedure applies in the frequency range of 0.015 to 30 MHz. A procedure for measurements in the frequency range of 20 to 1000 MHz, which is to be used only as a guide, is also presented.</abstract>
