    <abstract>Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of carbon steel pole-mounted enclosures containing apparatus energized in excess of 600 V, typically located out of reach of the general public, including, but not limited to, the following types of equipment enclosures: pole-mounted distribution transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted regulators, pole mounted metering equipment, pole mounted reclosers and pole-mounted switchgear, are covered. An error has been identified in the 2010 published version of the IEEE Standard C57.12.31. The number of cycles included in one of the corrosion testes is not correct. This error needs to be corrected which is a critical requirement of the standard.</abstract>
