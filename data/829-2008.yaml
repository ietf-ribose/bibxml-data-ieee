abstract:
- content: Test processes determine whether the development products of a given activity
    conform to the requirements of that activity and whether the system and/or software
    satisfies its intended use and user needs. Testing process tasks are specified
    for different integrity levels. These process tasks determine the appropriate
    breadth and depth of test documentation. The documentation elements for each type
    of test documentation can then be selected. The scope of testing encompasses software-based
    systems, computer software, hardware, and their interfaces. This standard applies
    to software-based systems being developed, maintained, or reused (legacy, commercial
    off-the-shelf, Non-Developmental Items). The term "software" also includes firmware,
    microcode, and documentation. Test processes can include inspection, analysis,
    demonstration, verification, and validation of software and software-based system
    products.
