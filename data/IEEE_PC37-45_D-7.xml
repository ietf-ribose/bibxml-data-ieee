    <abstract>This standard establishes specifications for high voltage (above 1000 volts) distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches and associated accessories with rated voltages from 1 through 8.3 Kv. All of these devices are intended for use on alternating current distribution systems. These specifications apply to the following specific types of equipment: a) Distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches. b) Supports, mountings, fuse hooks, tongs, all of the type used exclusively with distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches. c) Distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches used in enclosure packages.</abstract>
