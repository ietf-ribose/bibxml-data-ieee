    <abstract>This document provides requirements and guidance to information developers and related roles on how to adapt the processes described in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 265NN family of International Standards to develop quality information for users. This document is independent of the agile development methods and tools that are used to produce the software. This document gives an overview of agile methodologies although it neither encourages nor discourages the use of any particular agile methodology. Therefore, this document uses generic agile terminology as much as possible.</abstract>
