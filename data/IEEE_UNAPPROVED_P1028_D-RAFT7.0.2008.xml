    <abstract>This standard defines five types of software reviews and audits, together with procedures required for the execution of each type. This standard is concerned only with the reviews and audits; it does not define procedures for determining the necessity of a review or audit, nor does it specify the disposition of the results of the review or audit. Types include management reviews, technical reviews, inspections, walk-throughs, and audits.</abstract>
