abstract:
- content: In this amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.4(TM)-2011, outdoor low-data-rate,
    wireless, television white space (TVWS) network requirements are addressed. Alternate
    physical layers (PHYs) are defined as well as only the medium access control (MAC)
    modifications needed to support their implementation.
