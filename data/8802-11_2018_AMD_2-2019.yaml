abstract:
  content: Modifications to both the IEEE 802.11(TM) physical layer (PHY) and the
    medium access control (MAC) sublayer to enable operation of license-exempt IEEE
    802.11 wireless networks in frequency bands below 1 GHz, excluding the television
    (TV) White Space bands, with a transmission range up to 1 km and a minimum data
    rate of at least 100 Kb/s are defined in this amendment.
