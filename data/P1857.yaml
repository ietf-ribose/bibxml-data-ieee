abstract:
  content: Multimedia data has become the majority of data flooding the Internet.
    The standard specifies the video compression, decompression and packaging tools
    and mechanism to support the transmission and store of the multimedia data over
    Internet in a highly efficient way under constraints that include limited complexity
    and bandwidth. This part of the standard defines a set of tools for high efficient
    video coding, including multiple directional intra prediction, variable block
    size inter prediction and context adaptive binary arithmetic coding etc. Moreover,
    it specifies the decoding procedure. The target applications and services include
    but not limited TV over Internet, User Generated Multimedia Content, IP-based
    video conference, IP-based surveillance and other video enabled services and applications
    such as digital television broadcasting, digital storage media, and communication.
