    <abstract>IEC/IEEE 60079-30-1 is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the essentialrequirements and testing appropriate to electric surface heating equipment used in explosiveatmospheres. The requirements of this part of IEC 60079 are considered to be the minimumrequirements for equipment protection levels Gb, Gc, Db, and Dc in explosive atmospheresfor gases, dusts, and fibres/flyings. While some of this work already exists in nationalstandards or international standards, this standard has collated much of this existing work andconsiderably added to it. This standard also contains the minimum requirements for usersapplying the Division method of area classification.</abstract>
