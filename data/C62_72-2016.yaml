abstract:
- content: Guidance is provided to specifiers, users and manufacturers of surge-protective
    devices (SPDs) about the application considerations of SPDs to power distribution
    systems and associated equipment. This guide applies to SPDs to be connected to
    the load side of the service equipment (and main over current protective device)
    of 50 Hz or 60 Hz ac power circuits rated 1000 V ac or less. Information on surge
    origins, effects of surges, number and magnitude of surge events, location categories,
    power distribution system (PDS) configurations, grounding and bonding, SPD specifications,
    SPD ratings, SPD characteristics, SPD lifetime, interactions of SPDs with a PDS,
    and SPD coordination considerations are provided in the guide.
