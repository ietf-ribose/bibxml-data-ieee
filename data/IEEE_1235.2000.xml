    <abstract>" Identification markings of jacketed underground power cables and ducts are establishedin this guide. Included are various methods of identifying underground power cables and ducts, andthe visual, chemical, and mechanical properties of the identification materials and/or methods, andtheir impact on the properties of the overall jacket or duct as well as their impact on installationpractices.
