    <abstract>This recommended practice is focused on the wide-band measurement of the apparent charge of partial discharges (PD) which may occur in liquid-filled power transformers and shunt reactors excited by AC test voltages between 40 and 400 Hz. The major components of the PD measuring circuit including the calibrator are specified in compliance with the relevant standard IEC 60270. Furthermore, the PD test procedure is described and recommendations for the evaluation of PD test results are presented.</abstract>
