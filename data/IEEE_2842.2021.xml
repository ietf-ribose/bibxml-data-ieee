    <abstract>Data has become one of the most important assets in ICT area. Secure multi-party computation plays a very important role in balancing data usage and data protection. It could build trust and security in data collaboration and big data analysis related areas. A technical framework for secure multi-party computation is provided in this standard, including specifying the following: an overview of secure multi-party computation; a technical framework of secure multi-party computation; security levels of secure multi-party computation; and use cases based on secure multi-party computation.</abstract>
