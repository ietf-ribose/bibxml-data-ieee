abstract:
  content: The standard sets forth the requirements for a calibration program to control
    and verify the accuracy of measuring and test equipment used to ensure that safety
    systems of a nuclear facility are in conformance with prescribed technical requirements
    and that data provided by testing, inspection, or maintenance are valid. These
    requirements also cover modifications and those activities occurring during the
    operating phase that are comparable in nature and extent to related activities
    occurring during the initial construction of the facility.<<ETX>>
