    <abstract>All relevant behavior and states of the Media Management System (MMS) and the Media Manager (MM) from the time the MMS application successfully establishes a session with the MM, until the session is severed is described. This standard specifies the behavior of the MM itself in response to certain MMP commands and events that occur during the existence of the MM, including but not limited to booting the MM and the un-commanded exit of a MMS client.</abstract>
