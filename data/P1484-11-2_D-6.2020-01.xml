    <abstract>An ECMAScript application programming interface (API) for content-to-runtime-services communication is described in this standard. It is based on a current industry practice called “CMI--computer managed instruction.” This API enables the communication of information between content and a runtime service (RTS) typically provided by a learning management system (LMS) via common API services using the ECMAScript language. The purpose of this standard is to build consensus around, resolve ambiguities, and correct defects in existing specifications for an ECMA¬Script API for exchanging data between learning-related content and an LMS.</abstract>
