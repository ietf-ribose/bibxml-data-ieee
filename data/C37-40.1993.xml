    <abstract>Service conditions and definitions for high-voltage fuses (above 1000 V), distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for ac distribution systems are covered. These include enclosed, open, and open-link types of distribution cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses; distribution oil cutouts; distribution enclosed single-pole air switches; power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor and indoor fuse disconnecting switches; fuse supports, mountings, hooks, and links, all of the type used exclusively with the above; and removable switch blades for certain products among the above.</abstract>
