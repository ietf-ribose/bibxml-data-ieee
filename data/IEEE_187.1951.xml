    <abstract>Modern broadcast radio receivers of the super-heterodyne type are frequently sources of spurious radiation from the local oscillator, which radiation may cause severe interference with other services. In addition, in the case of television broadcast receivers, there may be radiation of power from other sources beside the local oscillator. This Standard describes the potential sources of spurious radiation from frequency modulation and television broadcast receivers and sets up methods of measurement whereby the strength of some of these radiations may be determined. Where the method for the two classes of receivers differ, the specifications for each are outlined</abstract>
