    <abstract>The methods and requirements for qualifying switchgear assemblies for indoor areas outside of the containment in nuclear power generating stations are described in this document. These assemblies include: metal-enclosed low-voltage power circuit breaker switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.1™; metal-clad switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.2™; metal-enclosed bus, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.23™; and metal-enclosed interrupter switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.3™.</abstract>
