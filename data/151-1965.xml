  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This Standard is issued to supersede 58 IRE 3. SI, "IRE Standards on Audio Techniques:Definitions of Terms, 1958," to include the definitions of the 1958 Standards and to adddefinitions of terms for which it was felt a need exists for establishment of precise and concisemeanings. Some of the previous standard definitions have been modified to accommodatechanges in usage.The definitions included in this Standard all refer specifically to the use of the terms inaudio techniques. Many of these terms are used in other fields with different meanings, andit is assumed that definitions for these terms in those fields are or will be included in Standardsissued by other committees. Therefore, in general, the modifying phrase "In Audio Techniques"has been omitted except in certain cases where it appears to be particularly necessaryto avoid confusion.</abstract>
