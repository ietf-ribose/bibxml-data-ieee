    <abstract>This guide discusses operational parameters that may be observed by battery monitoring equipment used in stationary applications, and the relative value of such observations. Although this guide does not give a listing of commercially available systems, it does provide a means for establishing specifications for the desired parameters to be monitored.</abstract>
