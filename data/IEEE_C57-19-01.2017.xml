    <abstract>Electrical, dimensional, and related requirements for power transformer and reactor bushings that have basic impulse insulation levels (BILs) of 150 kV and above are covered. Specific values for dimensional and related requirements that are to be interpreted, measured, or tested, in accordance with IEEE Std C57.19.00â„¢, are provided.</abstract>
