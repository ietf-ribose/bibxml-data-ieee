    <abstract>Mechanical characteristics of conduction-cooled versions of Eurocard-based circuit card assemblies are described. This specification is applicable to, but not limited to, the VMEbus standard, an internal interconnect (backplane) bus intended for connecting processing elements to their immediate fundamental resources. The aim is to ensure mechanical interchangeability of conduction-cooled circuit card assemblies in a format suitable for military and rugged applications and to ensure their compatibility with commercial, double-height, 16 mm, Eurocard chassis.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
