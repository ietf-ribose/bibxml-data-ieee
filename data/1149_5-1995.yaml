abstract:
  content: This standard specifies a serial, backplane, test and maintenance bus (MTM-Bus)
    that can be used to integrate modules form different teams or vendors into testable
    and maintainable subsystems. Physical, link, and command layers are specified.
    Standard interface protocol and commands can be used to provide the basic test
    and maintenance features needed for a module as well as access to on-module assets
    (memory, peripherals, etc.) and IEEE Std 1149.1 boundary-scan. Standard commands
    and functions support fault isolation to individual modules and test of backplane
    interconnect between modules.
