    <abstract>Minimum performance specifications and testing methods for the evaluation of alarming personal radiation detectors, also known as PRDs, are contained in this standard. These detectors are pocket-sized and carried on the body. These instruments are primarily designed for the detection and location of radioactive materials emitting gamma rays, and possibly neutrons, and not intended to function as electronic dosimeters. The specifications for general, radiological, environmental, electromagnetic, and mechanical performance are given, and the corresponding testing methods are described. The documentation to be provided by the manufacturer is listed as part of the requirements. A number of informative annexes that provide useful information and guidance in implementing this standard are also contained in this standard.</abstract>
