    <abstract>This standard identifies Open System Interfaces for High Power Electronics Equipment used in Zonal Electrical Distribution Systems rated above 100 kW. The required Power, Monitoring, Information Exchange, Control, and Protection Interfaces are based on technological maturity, accepted practices and allowances for future technology insertions. The standard also defines how Openness of System should be verified and validated through rigorous assessment mechanism, interface control management and proactive conformance testing to enable plug-and-play operability independently of components origin. Standard's applications include airports, hospitals, major data processing centers (especially those using uninterruptible power supply), broadcast systems, and maritime vessels and platforms. Existing terrestrial utilities power systems generally do not yet contain the electronic power interfaces and high speed communication networks that are essential to use of this standard, however the standard shall be applied to upgrade existing legacy systems.</abstract>
