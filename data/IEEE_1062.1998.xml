    <abstract>IEEE Std 1062, 1998 Edition (R2002), Includes IEEE Std 1062-1993 and IEEE Std 1062a-1998. A set of useful quality practices that can be selected and applied during one or moresteps in a software acquisition process is described. This recommended practice can be applied tosoftware that runs on any computer system regardless of the size, complexity, or criticality of thesoftware, but is more suited for use on modified-off-the-shelf software and fully developed software.</abstract>
