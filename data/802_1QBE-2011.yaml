abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011 specifies protocols, procedures,
    and managed objects to support topology change signaling to alter the binding
    (held in an l-Component) of Customer addresses to Backbone addresses on a per-l-SID
    basis. This is accomplished by extending the use of the Multiple Registration
    Protocol (MRP).
