  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This standard provides definitions and explanations of key concepts in the fields of spectrum management, cognitive radio, policy-defined radio, adaptive radio, software-defined radio, and related technologies. The document goes beyond simple, short definitions by providing amplifying text that explains these terms in the context of the technologies that use them. The document also describes how these technologies interrelate and create new capabilities while at the same time providing mechanisms supportive of new spectrum management paradigms such as dynamic spectrum access.</abstract>
  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">Because of the complexity and interrelationship of some of the terms used in discussing advanced radio system technologies, additional tutorial material is provided in informative annexes and NOTES. It is the purpose of this additional tutorial material to amplify and clarify the briefer definitions. However, it is not the intent of this informative text to provide an exhaustive description of these technologies and new spectrum management concepts, but to provide high-level descriptive information to supplement the brief definitions. Clause 2 of the document provides definitions of advanced radio system terms, whereas Clause 3 defines the functional capabilities associated with these systems. Clause 4 defines some network technologies that support the distributed functionality of these systems. Spectrum management terms and definitions are found in Clause 5. Ancillary terms are found in Clause 6. The annexes are non-normative (not part of the standard) but are included to provide additional information on the advanced radio system and spectrum management concepts that are the focus of this standard.</abstract>
