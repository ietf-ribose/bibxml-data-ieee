    <abstract>Define structures in STIL for the specification of resource mapping of ATE hardware architectures. An example of resource mapping is the assignment of tester resources to waveform characters that are used in STIL-vectors. Define structures in STIL for including ATE specific instructions in-line with the STIL data. Define structures in STIL that allow for 'incremental processing' whereby, a set of STIL files may be targeted to mutliple ATE systems by allowing separately identified ATE data to co-exist. Define structures in STIL for defining tester rules checks to ensure that the set of generated STIL files conform to the selected resources on one or more ATE systems. Define structures in STIL for the specification of the resources required for the execution of a set of STIL files on a given ATE system.</abstract>
