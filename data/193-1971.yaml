abstract:
  content: This standard specifies the "weighted peak" method of measurement for predicting
    subjective flutter of sound recorders and reproducers for normal audio usage.
    For special purposes - high speed duplicators, different speeds in recording and
    reproducing, etc - special procedures not described here must be used.
