    <abstract>Revision of IEEE Std 1187-1996. This guide describes methods for selecting the appropriate type of valve-regulated, immobilized-electrolyte, recombinant lead-acid battery for any of a variety of stationary float applications. The purpose of this document is to ensure that the reader is aware of all significant issues that should be considered when selecting VRLA batteries, so that the user might make an informed decision.</abstract>
