    <abstract>This project is to develop a standard for 50 and 60 Hz liquid immersed distribution substation transformers with ratings of 10 000 kVA and below three phase, 6667 kVA and below single phase with a primary voltage 69 000 and below, and a secondary voltage of 34 500 and below. The standard will cover indoor/outdoor application, cover/wall terminations and switchgear coordination issues.</abstract>
