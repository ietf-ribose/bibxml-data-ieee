abstract:
  content: The purpose of this standard is to provide uniform, minimum acceptable
    requirements for preparation and content of Software Quality Assurance Plans (SQAP).
    This standard applies to the development and maintenance of critical software;
    for example, where failure could impact safety or cause large financial or social
    losses. For non-critical software, or for software already developed, a subset
    of the requirements of this standard may be applied. The existence of this standard
    should not be construed to prohibit additional content in a Software Quality Assurance
    Plan. An assessment should be made for the specific software product item to assure
    adequacy of coverage. Where this standard is invoked for a project engaged in
    producing several software items, the applicability of the standard should be
    specified for each of the software product items encompassed by the project.
