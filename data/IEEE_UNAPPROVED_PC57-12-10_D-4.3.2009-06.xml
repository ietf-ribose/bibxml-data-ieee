    <abstract>This voluntary consensus standard sets forth the requirements for outdoor power transformer application. This standard is intended for use as a basis for performance, interchangeability, and safety of equipment covered, and to assist in the proper selection of such equipment. This is a product standard which covers certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics of 50 and 60 Hz, liquid immersed power and auto-transformers. Such power transformers may be remotely or integrally associated with either primary switchgear or substations, or both, for step-down or step-up purposes base rated as follows: 833 KVA and above single-phase, 750 KVA and above three-Phase. This standard applies to all liquid-immersed power and auto transformers that do not belong to the following types of apparatus: Instrument Transformers, Step voltage and induction voltage regulators, Arc-Furnace Transformers, Rectifier Transformers, Specialty Transformers, Grounding Transformers, Mobile Transformers, Mine Transformers</abstract>
