  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This standard establishes uniform procedures for the measurement of radio noise generated by corona from overhead power lines and substations. Measurement procedures in this standard are also valid for other power-line noise sources such as gaps and harmonics; however, most of the precautionary information, analysis, and data plotting techniques were written and developed primarily for corona discharges. The procedures are not valid for measuring transient radio noise sources that occur during breaker or disconnect switching operations. The procedures apply in the frequency range of 0.010- MHz to 1000 MHz; however, the emphasis is on the standard amplitude-modulation broadcasting (0.535 MHz to -1.605 MHz) and television broadcasting (54- MHz to 72 MHz, 76 MHz to -88 MHz, 174 MHz to- 216 MHz, and 470- MHz to 698 MHz) bands. This standard is applicable to both ac and dc transmission lines and substations.</abstract>
