    <abstract>Additional computer specific requirements to supplement the criteria and requirements of IEEE Std 603-1998 are specified. Within the context of this standard, the term computer is a system that includes computer hardware, software, firmware, and interfaces. The criteria contained herein, in conjunction with criteria in IEEE Std 603-1998, establish minimum functional and design requirements for computers used as components of a safety system.</abstract>
