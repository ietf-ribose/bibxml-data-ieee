    <abstract>The basic dimensions of a range of modular subracks conforming to IEC 60297-3 (1984-01) and IEC 60297-4 (1995-03) for mounting in equipment according to IEC 60297-1 (1986-09) and ANSI/EIA 310-D-1992, together with the basic dimensions of a compatible range of plug-in units, printed boards, and backplanes, are covered. The dimensions and tolerances necessary to ensure mechanical function compatibility are provided. This standard offers total system integration guidelines with attendant advantages, such as reduction in design and development time, manufacturing cost savings, and distinct marketing advantages.</abstract>
