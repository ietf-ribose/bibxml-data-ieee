    <abstract>Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of the communication between medication monitoring devices and managers (e.g. cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and information models. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting ambiguity in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication functionality for medication monitors. In this context, medication monitors are defined as devices that have the ability to determine and communicate (to a manager) measures of a user's adherence to a medication regime.</abstract>
