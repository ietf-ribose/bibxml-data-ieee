    <abstract>This standard sets forth the requirements for installation, inspection, and testing of power, instrumentation, and control equipment and systems during the construction phase of a nuclear facility. These requirements also cover modifications and those operating phase activities that are comparable in nature and extent to related initial construction activities of the facility. The intent of this standard is to establish requirements for safety systems equipment. (Safety systems equipment defined in IEEE Std 603-1980.1) However, this standard may also be applied to non-safety systems equipment.</abstract>
