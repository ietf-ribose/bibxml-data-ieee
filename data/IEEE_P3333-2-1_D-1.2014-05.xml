    <abstract>This standard describes the generation and practical use of medical three-dimensional (3D) modeling for diagnostics and therapeutic applications. It includes volume rendering and surface rendering techniques for 3D reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) medical images and a texturing method of 3D medical data for realistic visualization.</abstract>
