    <abstract>Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage batteries used for standby power applications are provided. This recommended practice also provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. This recommended practice is applicable to all stationary applications. However, specific applications, such as emergency lighting units and semiportable equipment, may have other appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. An interpretation for this standard is available at http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/interps/450-1995_int/index.html</abstract>
