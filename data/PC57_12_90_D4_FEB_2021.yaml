abstract:
  content: Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00&#8482; and
    other standards 1 applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating
    transformers are described. 2 Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction
    voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty
    transformers, grounding transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. Resistance
    measurements, polarity and phase-relation tests, ratio tests, no-load loss and
    excitation current measurements, impedance and load loss measurements, dielectric
    tests, temperature tests, short-circuit tests, audible sound level measurements,
    and calculated data are covered in this standard.
