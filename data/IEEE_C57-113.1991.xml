    <abstract>The detection and measurement by the wide-band apparent charge method of partial discharges occurring in liquid-filled power transformers and shunt reactors during dielectric tests are covered. This standard covers the measuring instrument, calibrator characteristics, test circuits, calibration procedure, and partial discharge measurement during induced-voltage tests.</abstract>
