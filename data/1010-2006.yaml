abstract:
  content: This guide is to serve as a reference document for practicing engineers
    in the hydroelectric industry. It documents prevailing industry practices in hydroelectric
    power plant control system logic, control system configurations, and control modes.
    It describes the control and monitoring requirements for equipment and systems
    associated with conventional and pumped-storage hydroelectric plants. It includes
    typical methods of local and remote control, details of the control interfaces
    for plant equipment, requirements for centralized and off-site control.
