    <abstract>The standards in this section apply to the following types of rotating machines: 1. induction motors larger than fractional horse power; 2. induction generators, they are applicable also to induction machines in general. Alternating-current commutator motors are not covered in detail but they shall conform to these Standards as regards ratings, temperature rises and dielectric tests.</abstract>
