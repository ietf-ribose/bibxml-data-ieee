    <abstract>The evaluation and handling procedures for natural ester transformer insulating fluids are covered. The transformer operator is assisted by the purpose of the guide, which is to evaluate the serviceability of new, unused fluids being received by the equipment manufacturer or service company and fluid in new equipment. The operator is also assisted by the guide in maintaining the fluids in serviceable condition.</abstract>
