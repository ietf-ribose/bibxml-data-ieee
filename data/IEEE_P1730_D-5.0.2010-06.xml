    <abstract>This document describes the Recommended Practice for Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP). The DSEEP is intended as a high-level process framework into which the lower-level systems engineering practices native to any distributed simulation user can, such as DIS, HLA and TENA, be easily integrated.</abstract>
