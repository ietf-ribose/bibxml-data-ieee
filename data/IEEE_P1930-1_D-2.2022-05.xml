    <abstract>This Recommended Practice specifies an SDN middleware to support unified control and management of multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT) wireless access networks for Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond. It also defines an SDN based architecture, which facilitates Radio Access Network (RAN) level inter-working and unification of RATs.</abstract>
