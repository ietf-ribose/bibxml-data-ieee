    <abstract>Utility battery chargers for stationary battery installations are critical to maximize battery life while supporting the continuous loads on the dc system. This standard is applicable to battery chargers used for stationary applications. It was written to serve as a bridge between the utility application engineer and the charger manufacturer. It describes battery charger operating modes, performance, environmental/mechanical considerations, instrumentation and alarms.</abstract>
