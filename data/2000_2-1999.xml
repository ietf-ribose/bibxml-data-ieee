    <abstract>This document provides users of computer hardware, firmware, software, or data systems with recommended practices for assessing and demonstrating the system elements within their organization that may be at risk of failure due to the Year 2000 problem and related date-specific issues. This recommended practice provides the framework for detailed planning and execution of all steps and tasks involved in testing for Year 2000 compliance. The resulting plan will outline the testing approach and identify system elements that are at risk of failure when crossing into the Year 2000 or using data that includes dates after 2000-01-01.</abstract>
