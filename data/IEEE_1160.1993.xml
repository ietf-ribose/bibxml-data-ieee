    <abstract>This standard applies to the measurement of bulk properties of high-purity germanium as they relate to fabrication and performance of germanium detectors for gamma rays and x rays. Such germanium is monocrystalline and has a net concentration of fewer than 1011 electrically active impurity center per cm3, usually on the order of 1010 cm-3.</abstract>
