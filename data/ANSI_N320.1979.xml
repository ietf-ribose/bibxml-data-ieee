    <abstract>The essential performance parameters and general placement for monitoring the release of radionuclides associated with a postulated serious accident at a reactor facility are defined for various types of instrumentation. The predominant consideration in the assessment of radiation emergencies is the measurement of fission products made promptly enough to permit timely emergency decisions. This standard does not specify which of the instruments or systems are required, nor does it consider the number or specific locations of such instruments. This standard also does not address single failure criteria associated with nuclear safety instrumentation.</abstract>
