abstract:
  content: This standard applies to surge protectors for application on multiconductor
    and coaxial, balanced or unbalanced, data, communications, and signaling circuits
    with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V rms, or 1200 V dc. These surge protectors
    are intended to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both. The surge protectors
    covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear
    elements, packaged for the purpose of limiting voltage, current, or both. The
    tables of typical performance values of this standard provide a means of comparison
    among various surge protectors. They also provide a common engineering language
    beneficial to the user and manufacturer of surge protectors used in low-voltage
    data, communications, and signaling circuits.
