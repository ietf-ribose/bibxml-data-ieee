    <abstract>Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of pole-mounted enclosures containing apparatus energized in excess of 600 V, and for application in coastal environments, are specified in this standard. These enclosures are typically located out of reach of the general public, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of equipment enclosures: pole-mounted distribution transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted regulators, pole-mounted metering equipment, pole-mounted reclosers, and pole-mounted switchgear.</abstract>
