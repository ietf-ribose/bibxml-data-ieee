    <abstract>Names and letter symbols for prefixes that denote multiplication of a unit by the binary multiplier 2 10n, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 are defined. Although the prefixes may be used with all units in all fields where multiplication by a binary multiplier is found to be appropriate, their primary use is in the field of information technology.</abstract>
