    <abstract>The architecture and requirements for next generation fronthaul networks are specified in this standard. NGFI-I is defined as the next generation fronthaul network with low layer splits in a baseband station. NGFI-II is defined as the next generation fronthaul network with high layer splits in a baseband station. The requirements of fronthaul transport nodes in these networks are also specified.</abstract>
