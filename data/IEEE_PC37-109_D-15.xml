    <abstract>The scope of the original standard was a guide for acceptable methods and configurations for the protection of shunt reactors. This PAR's intent is to make the existing guide more comprehensive by including reactor configurations and reactor protection schemes not now in the guide. Review and updating of the existing guide is needed to consider protection of shunt reactors with auxiliary power windings, improved turn-to-turn fault protection, use of digital/microprocessor relays and other items specific to shunt reactor protection as brought before the working group.</abstract>
