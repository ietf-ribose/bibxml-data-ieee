    <abstract>The definitions assembled in this revised Report have been taken largely from the latest approved sections of the A. I. E. E. Standards. In some cases several similar definitions are listed, these differing from each other in varying degrees. It was deemed desirable to again call attention to these inconsistencies in this way in order to expedite the work of standardization of the definitions. Many definitions are now included which were not in the August 1927 edition, as they been taken from Sections of the Standards approved since that time. Sections of the Standards approved since that time.</abstract>
