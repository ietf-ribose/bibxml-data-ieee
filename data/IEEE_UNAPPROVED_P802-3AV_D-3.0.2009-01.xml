    <abstract>This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2008 provides physical layer specifications and management parameters for 10G-EPON on point-to-multipoint passive optical networks. 10G-EPON uses the network architecture of IEEE Std 802.3Â¿s 1G-EPON, providing support for both symmetric and asymmetric data rates while maintaining complete backward compatibility with already deployed equipment.</abstract>
