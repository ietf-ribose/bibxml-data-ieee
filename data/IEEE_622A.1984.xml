    <abstract>Recommended practices for designing and installing electric pipe heating control and alarm systems, as applied to mechanical piping systems that require heat, are provided. The recommendations include selection of control and alarm systems, accuracy considerations, local control usage, centralized control usage, qualification criteria of controls and alarms, and calibration and testing of controls and alarms. The intent is to ensure design consistency and reliable operation of electric pipe heating control and alarm systems, which in turn will ensure that piping system fluids will be available for use not only during station operation but also during normal shutdown.</abstract>
