    <abstract>This guide suggests surge arrester installation methods at distribution cable terminal poles in order to minimize the total impressed transient voltage on medium-voltage distribution cables. Grounding electrode techniques, pole ground values, and system ground grid values are not addressed or considered in this document.</abstract>
