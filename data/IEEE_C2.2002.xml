    <abstract>This Preprint provides the full text of each proposal to revise the 1997 Edition of the NESC together with the recommendation of the subcommittee that has cognizance of the rule addresses by the change proposal (CP). A change bar, located in the left hand margin, signifies the specific material that the various subcommittees each have approved for inclusion in the revised Code. Two of the change proposals submitted apply to relatively large numbers of rules. For this reason, the Preprint is divided into two groups as follows: I. General. Change proposals that apply to a single rule or to a few closely related rules. This includes a proposal that is contained in an unnumbered section of the NESC (Letter Symbols for Units), and a proposal that affects three parts of the Code. II. Reorganization of Sections 25 and 26 on Loading and Strength of Overhead Lines. Contains CP 2372, which is a continuation of CP 1964 from the Preprint 1997 Proposals of the NESC. This CP consolidates similar requirements of similar Rules in Sections 25 and 26.</abstract>
