abstract:
  content: An application guide for the design, installation, testing, commissioning
    and maintenance of skin effect trace heating systems for pipelines, vessels, equipment,
    and structures intended for use in general industrial applications are provided
    in this standard. This standard provides requirements when utilizing skin effect
    trace heating systems in ordinary as well as hazardous areas having potentially
    explosive atmospheres.
