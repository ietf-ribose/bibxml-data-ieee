    <abstract>Cybersecurity measures require that a balance be achieved between technical feasibility and economic feasibility and that this balance addresses the risks expected to be present at a substation. Further, cybersecurity measures must be designed and implemented in such a manner that access and operation to legitimate activities is not impeded, particularly during times of emergency or restoration activity. This standard presents a balance of the above factors.</abstract>
