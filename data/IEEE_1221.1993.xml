    <abstract>Fire hazards from electrical distribution and utilization systems installed in industrial, residential, and public buildings/areas are covered. A method for practical fire hazard assessment for electrical equipment containing insulating materials, based on relevant fire or failure scenarios drawn from service experience and engineering analysis, is established. The relationship between small-scale material tests and large- scale fire hazard tests is discussed. Written for the electrical engineer responsible for the safety of electrical systems and equipment, this guide provides guidelines for design of insulation systems and selection of insulating materials and aids in the use of codes, regulations, standards, product listings, and testing to improve safety.</abstract>
