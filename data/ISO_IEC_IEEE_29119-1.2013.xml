    <abstract>The purpose of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards is to define an internationally-agreed set of standards for software testing that can be used by any organization when performing any form of software testing. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 facilitates the use of the other ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 standards by introducing the concepts and vocabulary on which these standards are built, as well as providing examples of its application in practice. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 is informative, providing a starting point, context, and guidance for the other parts.</abstract>
