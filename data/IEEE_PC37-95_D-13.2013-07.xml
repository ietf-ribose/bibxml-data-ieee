    <abstract>This guide applies to protective relay applications involving electric service to consumers that requires a transformation between the utilitys supply voltage and the consumers utilization voltage. It describes the factors that need to be considered in the design of adequate protection facilities, outlines modern relay practices, and provides several examples of the protection of typical utility-consumer interconnections.</abstract>
