    <abstract>Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of carbon steel pole-mounted enclosures containing apparatus energized in excess of 600 V, and not for application in coastal or other severe environments, are specified in this standard. These enclosures are typically located out of reach of the general public, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of equipment enclosures: pole-mounted distribution transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted regulators, pole-mounted metering equipment, pole-mounted reclosers, and pole-mounted switchgear.</abstract>
