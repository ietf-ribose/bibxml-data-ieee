abstract:
  content: The development and application of the requirements of the Grounding Rules,
    General Rules and Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 of ANSI C2-2002, the National Electrical
    Safety Code (NESC) are discussed and illustrated. Where the requirements of the
    2007 Edition of the NESC differ from those of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 1973, 1977,
    1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1997, or 2002 Editions, the changes are clearly
    indicated. Sections of the text are identified by the NESC rule to which they
    refer; rule numbers that differ from those in an earlier edition are cross-indexed.
    Requirements of earlier editions for which no similar requirement exists in the
    1973 or later editions, such as requirements for radio installations, either are
    not discussed or are discussed in less detail. In many cases, the evolution of
    rules from inception to the present is provided. The discussions and illustrations
    in this document are developed from the texts of all prior editions of the NESC,
    the published official Discussions of the 5th and prior editions, the unpublished
    Discussion of the 6th Edition, all official Interpretations of the Code, the Rationales
    issued with public drafts, Change Proposals and Subcommittee Recommendations (including
    Comments and final Subcommittee decisions thereon), and the editor's and reviewers'
    knowledge of items considered during revision of the 1973 and later editions.
    This document is intended specifically to aid users in understanding and correctly
    applying the requirements of the Grounding Rules, General Rules, and Parts 1,
    2, 3, and 4 of the 2007 Edition of the NESC. It also is intended to aid those
    users in jurisdictions where earlier editions of the Code have been adopted or
    otherwise used by the administrative authority, or when considering facilities
    constructed under earlier editions of the NESC. It is especially useful to users
    of new or nonstandard designs, or construction, operation, and maintenance methods,
    for which specific requirements have not been detailed in the Code, as an aid
    in assuring that such installations and activities are consistent with the intent
    of the Code.
