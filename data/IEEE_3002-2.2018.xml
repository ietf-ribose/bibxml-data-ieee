    <abstract>Activities related to load flow analysis, including design considerations for new systems, analytical studies for existing systems, as well as operational and model validation considerations for industrial and commercial power systems are addressed. Load flow analysis includes steadystate power flow and voltage analysis along with considerations for optimal power flow calculations. The use of computer-aided analysis software, with a list of desirable capabilities recommended to conduct a modern load-flow study, is emphasized. Examples of system data requirements and result analysis techniques are presented.</abstract>
