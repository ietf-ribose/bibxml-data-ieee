    <abstract>This revision addresses substantive changes to Clause 5, 10 and 11 of existing C57.12.91-2001 to reflect current practice in the testing procedures of dry-type transformers. This revision does not address transformer requirements and specific test criteria; rather they are contained in appropriate standards such as IEEE Std C57.12.01-2005 or in user specifications.</abstract>
