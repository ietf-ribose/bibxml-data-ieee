    <abstract>The guide is to aid wire and cable manufacturers in the study of smoke generation characteristics of materials used in products. The two test methods looked at are the NBS method, where measurement is made of the attenuation of a light beam by the smoke, and the Arapahoe method, where smoke and char are measured gravimetrically under dynamic conditions.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
