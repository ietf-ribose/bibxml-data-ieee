abstract:
  content: 'The current methodologies, including apparatus, procedures, and measurement
    accuracies, for determining the dynamic characteristics of vibration dampers and
    damping systems are described. Some basic guidance is provided regarding a given
    methodÂ¿s strengths and weaknesses. The methodologies and procedures described
    are applicable to indoor testing only. Keywords: aeolian, decay method, forced
    response method, inverse standing wave ratio (ISWR) method, overhead conductors,
    power dissipation characteristics, power method, vibration dampers.'
