abstract:
  content: Electrical and control design of water conveyance facilities associated
    with hydroelectric projects including associated penstocks, valves, and gates
    are described in this guide. Guidance to plan and prepare designs is included.
    Installation, operation, or maintenance guideline and methodologies are not included.
    Design of new facilities and rehabilitation or replacement of existing facilities
    is covered. Comprehensive considerations for design, monitoring, control, protection,
    and operation of water conveyance facilities associated with hydroelectric projects
    is provided. Guidance in electrical and instrumentation work unique to water conveyance
    systems is provided. Guidance for the safe control of water release systems, bypass
    systems, and failure modes are provided. Reliability measures such as redundancy
    and power source considerations are provided. Gate and valve types and associated
    operating mechanisms are introduced. Power and non-power water conduits including
    penstocks, tunnels and canals are coverd.
