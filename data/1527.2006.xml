    <abstract>The engineering and design of flexible bus connections for bus and equipment in electric power substations is described. This recommended practice gives guidance to the substation engineer who is unfamiliar with seismic considerations in the engineering and design of connections, and provides engineers with the current state of knowledge of the dynamic effects of high-voltage connections and conductors.</abstract>
