    <abstract>Application of IEEE Std 1547-2018 to the interconnection of energy storage distributed energy resources (ES DER) to electric power systems (EPSs) is described in this guide. Along with examples of such interconnection, guidance on prudent and technically sound approaches to these interconnections is also given. The guideâ€™s scope includes ES DER that are capable of exporting active power to an EPS. The guide also considers energy storage-related topics that are not currently addressed or fully covered in IEEE Std 1547-2018 and sets a basis for future development of industry best practices for ES DER-specific interconnection requirements that could be considered in future revisions of IEEE Std 1547.</abstract>
