    <abstract>This standard specifies a protocol enabling precise synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such as network communication, local computing and distributed objects. The protocol is applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. The protocol enables heterogeneous systems that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution and stability to synchronize. The protocol supports system-wide synchronization accuracy and precision in the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local clock computing resources. The default behavior of the protocol allows simple systems to be installed and operated without requiring the management attention of users.</abstract>
