    <abstract>Definitions of MAC related functions to enable spectrum resource management are addressed in this amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.4â„¢. It specifies the following: - Spectrum resource measurements and network performance metrics, such as packet error ratio, delay, etc. - Information elements and data structures to capture these measurements, - Procedures for collecting and exchanging spectrum resource measurement information with higher layers or otherre devices. The PDF of this standard is available at no cost to you compliments of the IEEE GET program. Visit https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page for more details.</abstract>
