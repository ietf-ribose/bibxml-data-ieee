abstract:
- content: 'High-frequency heating equipments divide into two main types: (1) those
    used for dielectric heating, and(2) those used for induction heating. The induction
    heating equipments again divide into seven types: (1) commercial power line; (2)
    rotary generator; (3) mercury-arc-converter; (4) gaseous-tube converter; (5) mercury-hydrogen-spark-gap
    converter; (6) quenched spark-gap converter; (7) vacuum-tube generator. Dielectric
    heating equipments in general use a vacuum-tube oscillator as a source of radio-frequency
    power ranging in frequency from 2 megacycles to hundreds of megacycles. At frequencies
    above about 200 megacycles,the power is generated by devices other than a conventional
    vacuum tube, such as a magnetron, Klystron or other microwave device. A dielectric
    heating generator is normally a high-voltage generator, and application requires
    high-voltage radio-frequency matching techniques. An induction heating generator
    is essentially a high-current device operating into very low impedance circuits
    and sometimes requires transformation in the load circuit to provide the desired
    heating effect.'
