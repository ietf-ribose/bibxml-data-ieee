    <abstract>This is a revision of a standard for the usual and unusual service conditions for power system communication equipment. It is similar to service conditions for relays, automatic station supervisory control, and telemetering equipment with which this communication equipment is used. IEEE Std 97-1969, IEEE Recommended Practice for Specifying Service Conditions in Electrical Standards, has been considered.</abstract>
