    <abstract>This recommended practice describes how to evaluate the reliability of existing industrial and commercial power systems. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience in the area of reliability. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.</abstract>
