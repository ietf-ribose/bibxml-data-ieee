    <abstract>This standard serves to aid the comparison of the relative merits of magnetostrictive, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostrictive transducers. The standard applies generally to magnetostrictive materials and was developed for those working on transducer applications. This revised standard was generated because of the development of a class of alloys that has made magnetostrictive materials more competitive with electrostrictive materials, especially for lower frequency applications.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
