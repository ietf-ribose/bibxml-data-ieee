abstract:
- content: This standard defines the preferred ratings for low-voltage AC (635 V and
    below) power circuit breakers, general purpose DC (325 V and below) power circuit
    breakers, heavy duty low voltage DC (3200 V and below) power circuit breakers,
    and fused (integrally or non-integrally) low voltage AC (600 V and below) power
    circuit breakers.
