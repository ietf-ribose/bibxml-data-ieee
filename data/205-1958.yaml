abstract:
  content: Describes methods of measuring the significant amplitude levels of a monochrome
    or color television signal, either composite or noncomposite. The author discusses
    measurements at points in transmission systems where the signals are at video
    frequency. The methods described in this Standard are limited to those involving
    the use of oscilloscopes, and are primarily directed to specifying means of measuring
    television signal levels for operating purposes.<<ETX>>
