abstract:
  content: It is the purpose of this Guide to describe and discuss the present state
    of the technique of measuring ground resistance and impedance, earth resistivity,
    and potential gradients resulting from currents in the earth and the prediction
    of the magnitudes of ground resistance and potential gradients from scale model
    tests.1 Factors governing the choice of instruments and the techniques for various
    types of work are covered, such as the purpose of the measurement, the accuracy
    required, the time and instruments available, and the nature of the ground or
    grounding system under test.
