    <abstract>A standard XML format for representing electronic design intellectual property (IP) quality information, based on an information model for IP quality measurement, is defined. It includes a schema and the terms that are relevant for measuring IP quality, including the software that executes on the system. The schema and information model can be focused to represent particular categories of interest to IP users. In the context of this document, the term IP shall be used to mean electronic design intellectual property. Electronic design intellectual property is a term used in the electronic design community to refer to a reusable collection of design specifications that represent the behavior, properties, and/or representation of the design in various media.</abstract>
