abstract:
  content: Minimum requirements for the construction, manufacturing, purchasing, and
    application of electric submersible pump (ESP) cable are presented. The cable
    is round or flat, with ethylene-propylene rubber insulation, nitrile jacket and
    armor. The recommendations apply to cables rated for voltages not exceeding 3
    kV or 5 kV and for ambient temperatures not exceeding 205 degrees Fahrenheit or
    below 14 degrees Fahrenheit. Conductors, insulation, assembly, jacket, armor,
    requirements for testing by the manufacturer, and cable ampacity ratings are covered.
