    <abstract>Superseded by 187-2003. IEEE Standard on Radio Receivers: Open Field Method of Measurement of Spurious Radiation from FM and Television Broadcast Receivers, describes the potential sources of spurious radiation from frequency modulation and television broadcast receivers and sets up methods of measurement. This standard is not intended to apply to equipment other than FM and television broadcast receivers.</abstract>
