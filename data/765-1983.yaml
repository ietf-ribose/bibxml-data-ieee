abstract:
  content: The design criteria of the preferred power supply (PPS) and its interfaces
    with the Class 1E power system, switchyard, transmission system, and alternate
    ac (AAC) source are described. This standard provides PPS requirements for nuclear
    power plants and guidance in the areas of AAC power source interfaces with PPS,
    physical independence of the PPS power and control circuits, and expanded PPS
    criteria for multi-unit stations.
