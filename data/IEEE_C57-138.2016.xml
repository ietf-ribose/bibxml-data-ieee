    <abstract>General test procedures for performing routine quality control tests that are suitable for high-volume, production line testing are included in this recommended practice. Transformer connections, test methods, circuit configurations, and failure detection methods are addressed. This recommended practice covers liquid-immersed, single- and three-phase distribution transformers.</abstract>
