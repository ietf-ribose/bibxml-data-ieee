    <abstract>This guide describes the most common sheath-bonding systems now in use on high voltage single-conductor shielded power cables and the methods of calculating sheath voltages and currents, particularly as applied to three-phase systems operating at 60 kV and above, with the neutral grounded directly or through an impedance. Although the following text on induced voltages and currents in metallic sheaths is written primarily around high-voltage cables operating at 60 kV and above, the fundamental principles in this document apply equally to single-conductor medium-voltage shielded power cables. The term "sheath" as used in the context of this document is intended to refer to "non-magnetic metallic shielding" and the two terms are used interchangeably irrespective of whether the metallic shield in fact conforms to the true definition of a sheath. Cable metallic sheaths/shields thus covered by this guide include various types of non-magnetic shielding including Copper, Aluminum, and Lead sheaths, as well as helical or longitudinally applied metal tapes, or wires, and various combinations thereof. The user is cautioned to make sure that a design does not contravene any local or national regulations.</abstract>
