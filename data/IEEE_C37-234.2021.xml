    <abstract>Principles of power bus protection are discussed. The availability and location of breakers, current sensing devices, and disconnect switches are addressed, as well as bus configurations and switching schemes and their impact on the selection and application of bus protection. Bus protection schemes are presented, and their characteristics, strengths, and limitations are examined. Bus protection applications are presented.</abstract>
