    The medium access control (MAC) and physical characteristics for wireless local
    area networks (LANs) are specified in this standard, which is part of a series
    of standards for local and metropolitan area networks. The medium access control
    unit in this standard is designed to support physical layer units as they may
    be adopted dependent on the availability of spectrum. This standard contains five
    physical layer units: four radio units, operating in the 2400-2500 MHz band and
    in the bands comprising 5.15-5.25 GHz, 5.25-5.35 GHz, and 5.725-5.825 GHz, and
    one baseband infrared (IR) unit. One radio unit employs the frequency-hopping
    spread spectrum (FHSS) technique, two employ the direct sequence spread spectrum
    (DSSS) technique, and another employs the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
    (OFDM) technique.'
