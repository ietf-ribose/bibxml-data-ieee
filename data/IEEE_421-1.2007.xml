    <abstract>This standard defines elements and commonly used components in excitation systems and contains definitions for excitation systems applied to synchronous machines. An included annex contains one-line block diagrams of some typical excitation systems. These are presented to illustrate the defined terminology referenced in this standard and clarify the understanding of the excitation control system.</abstract>
