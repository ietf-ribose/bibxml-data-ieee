  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">Experience and continuing rapid development in electrical insulation have demonstrated the need for periodic review and revision of this document. During the time since the 1962 revision of this document, there has been a need for a more distinct separation of insulation systems and insulating materials. Confusion in nomenclature be tween insulating materials and insulation systems has continued to exist. This present document attempt to overcome this conflict through the complete separation of insulating materials from insulation systems and by the introduction of the temperature index concept for insulating materials. To clarify this separation a distinct section, Part IV, is now provided for insulating materials.</abstract>
