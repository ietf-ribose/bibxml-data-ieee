    <abstract>A uniform method by which the thermal endurance of electrical insulation systems for dry-type specialty and general-purpose transformers can be compared is established. Covered are insulation systems intended for use in the types of transformers described in NEMA ST 1-1988 and NEMA ST 20-1992.</abstract>
