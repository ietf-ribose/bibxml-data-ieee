    <abstract>This document provides guidelines for the definition of a reliability program at nuclear generating stations and other nuclear facilities. The document emphasizes reliability programs during the operating phase of such facilities; however, the general approach applies to all phases (e.g., design, construction, start-up, operating, and decommissioning) of the facility.</abstract>
