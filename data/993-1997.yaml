abstract:
  content: A language useful for describing automatic test equipment (ATE) instrumentation
    and configurations, as well as interface test adapters (ITA), is defined. Principally
    intended for testing environments using the ATLAS test language, TEDL can also
    be used to describe instrumentation in non-ATLAS environments.
