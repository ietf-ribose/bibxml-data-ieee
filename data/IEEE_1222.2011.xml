    <abstract>This standard covers the construction, mechanical, electrical and optical performance, installation guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements, and environmental considerations for an all-dielectric self-supporting fiber optic cable designed to be located on overhead electric power utility and telecommunications facilities. This does not include cables used for underground installations.</abstract>
