    <abstract>Guidance for the designer/manufacturer/supplier in planning and implementing controls for the design and manufacture of lithium-ion and lithium-ion polymer rechargeable battery packs used for mobile computing devices is provided. The provisions of this standard work together, and they define approaches to design, test, and evaluate a cell, battery pack, and host device to mitigate battery system failure in end-user environments. Additionally, recommendations for end-user education and communication materials are provided in this standard. This approach suggests the interfaces between subsystems (e.g., cell, battery pack, host device) and end users are as important to system reliability as is robust subsystem design and testing. Therefore, subsystem interface design responsibilities for each subsystem designer/manufacturer/supplier are provided, as well as messaging and communication provisions for end-user awareness. The influence of the end user in system reliability is also recognized in this standard.</abstract>
