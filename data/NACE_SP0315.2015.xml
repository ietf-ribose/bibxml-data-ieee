    <abstract>This standard was prepared to assist personnel responsible for maintenance painting of above-grade electrical support structures for electric utilities and large industrial facilities. The standard provides procedures to (1) assess structures for atmospheric corrosion; (2) assess the level of risk to the structure in terms of corrosion attack and degradation to the existing coating system; (3) make informed decisions based on those findings as to whether coating repair is needed, and if so, to what extent; and (4) apply repair coatings to the structure if applicable. This standard applies to the repair of above-grade atmospheric coatings and serves as a resource for preparing specifications to achieve the successful coating of utility structures.</abstract>
