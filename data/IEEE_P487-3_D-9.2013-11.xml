    <abstract>This standard presents safe and reliable methods for the electrical protection of telecommunication facilities serving electric supply locations through the use of metallic wire-line components in part of the telecommunication circuit and optical fiber systems in the reminder of the telecommunication circuit. Hybrid applications have an equipment junction between the metallic wire-line and the fiber cable (CFJ or wire-line-fiber cable junction).</abstract>
