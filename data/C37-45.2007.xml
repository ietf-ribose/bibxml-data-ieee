    <abstract>IEEE specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches and associated accessories with rated voltages from 1 kV through 8.3 kV are established. All of these devices are intended for use on alternating current distribution systems. These include distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches, supports, mountings, fuse hooks, and tongs, all of the type used exclusively with distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches, and distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches used in enclosure packages.</abstract>
