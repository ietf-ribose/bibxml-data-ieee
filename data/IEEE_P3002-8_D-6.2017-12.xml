    <abstract>Harmonic studies and analysis of industrial and commercial power systems are described. The basic concepts involved in such studies are described first. This is followed by a discussion of how to determine the need for a harmonic study, how to assemble the required data, how to recognize potential problems, and how to implement corrective measures.</abstract>
