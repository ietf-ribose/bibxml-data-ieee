    <abstract>Methodologies for determination of the steady-state winding hottest-spot temperature in dry-type distribution and power transformers with ventilated, sealed, solid cast, and encapsulated windings built in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.01-1998 and IEC 60726 (1982-01) are de-scribed in this guide. Converter transformers are not included in this guide.</abstract>
