    <abstract>Information on the differences between stationary standby and stationary cycling applications and appropriate battery management strategies in cycling operations is covered in this guide. While the primary emphasis is on lead-acid batteries, information is also provided on alternative and emerging storage technologies. The management of battery systems in stationary standby service is covered in other IEEE documents and is beyond the scope of this guide.</abstract>
