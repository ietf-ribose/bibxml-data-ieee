    <abstract>This guide discusses principles of power bus protection. It addresses availability and location of breakers, current sensing devices, and disconnect switches as well as bus configurations and switching schemes and their impact on the selection and application of bus protection. Bus protection schemes are presented, and their characteristics, strengths, and limitations are examined. Bus protection applications are presented.</abstract>
