    <abstract>Guidelines for the definition of a reliability program at nuclear generating stations and other nuclear facilities are provided. The document emphasizes reliability programs during the operating phase of such stations; however, the general approach applies to all phases of the nuclear power generating station life cycle (e.g., design, construction, start-up, operating, and decommissioning).</abstract>
