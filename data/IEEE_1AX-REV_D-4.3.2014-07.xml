    <abstract>Link Aggregation allows parallel full duplex point-to-point links to be used as if they werea single link, and also supports the use of multiple links as a resilient load sharing interconnectbetween multiple nodes in two separately administered networks. This standard defines a MACindependent Link Aggregation capability, and general information relevant to specific to MAC types.</abstract>
