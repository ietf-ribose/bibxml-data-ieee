    <abstract>Guidelines and criteria for the design of substations that can withstand the effects of earthquakes are provided. These recommendations comprise an up-to-date summary of aseismic design practices that will be useful to substation engineers for effective aseismic design of substations and related facilities. Seismic criteria and performance requirements are set forth, qualification methods are discussed, and design and construction practices are presented.</abstract>
