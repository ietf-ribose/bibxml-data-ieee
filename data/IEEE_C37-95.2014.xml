    <abstract>Described in this guide are protective relay applications involving electric service to consumers that requires a transformation between the utility’s supply voltage and the consumer’s utilization voltage. It describes the factors that need to be considered in the design of adequate protection facilities, outlines modern relay practices, and provides several examples of the protection of typical utility-consumer interconnections.</abstract>
