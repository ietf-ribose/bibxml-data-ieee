    <abstract>This recommended practice presents engineering design practices for special high-voltage protection systems intended to protect wire-line telecommunication facilities serving electric supply locations. The following topics are included in this document: a) A description of the electric supply locations environment, i.e., ground potential rise (GPR), induced voltages, lightning, and switching transients; b)A discussion of special high-voltage protection devices; c)Definitions of service types and service performance objectives for electric supply locations telecommunication services; d)Special protection theory and philosophy; e)Special protection system design guidelines; f)Personnel safety considerations; g)Grounding; h)Cables with metallic members. Other telecommunication alternatives such as radio and optica fiber systems are excluded from this document.</abstract>
