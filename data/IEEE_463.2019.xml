    <abstract>Means for improved safeguarding of personnel while operating or maintaining equipment located in electrolytic cell line working zones are provided in this standard. Related requirements for equipment and electrical conductor installations are also included. The general types of electrolytic cells covered include, but are not limited to, the direct current cells used in the production of aluminum, cadmium, sodium chlorate, chlorine, copper, fluorine, hydrogen peroxide, magnesium, sodium, and zinc.</abstract>
