abstract:
  content: The procedures and calculations necessary to apply the standard transient
    recovery voltage (TRV) ratings for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above
    1000 V are covered in this guide. The breaking capability limits of these circuit
    breakers are determined to a great degree by the TRV. The TRV ratings are compared
    with typical system TRV duties. Examples of TRV calculation are given with suggested
    options if the TRV duty exceeds the TRV ratings of the circuit breaker.
