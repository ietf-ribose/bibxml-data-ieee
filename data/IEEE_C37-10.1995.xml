    <abstract>Procedures to be used to perform failure investigations of power circuit breakers are recommended. Although the procedure may be used for any circuit breaker, it is mainly focused on high-voltage ac power circuit breakers used on utility systems. Recommendations are also made for monitoring circuit breaker functions as a means of diagnosing their suitability for service condition.</abstract>
