    <abstract>This guide provides direction for establishing procedures that will yield data which verify that the Class I electric equipment can meet its performance requirements during and following a design basis earthquake. This guide may be used by equipment manufactures to establish procedures that will yield data to substantiate performance claims or by equipment users to evaluate and verify performance of representative devices and assemblies as part of an overall qualification efforts.</abstract>
