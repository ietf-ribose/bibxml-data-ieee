    <abstract>This standard provides direction for the design and installation of safety-related electrical cable systems, including associated circuits, in nuclear power generating stations. Also provided is guidance for the design, installation and performance requirements of those non-safety related cable systems that may affect the function of safety related systems. It provides guidance on applications of cable-penetration, fire stops, cable fire breaks, and cable-system enclosures for cable systems for Class 1E circuits.</abstract>
