abstract:
  content: Requirements for 60-Hz cylindrical-rotor synchronous generators, except
    those covered in standard C50.14-1977, are set forth. The standard covers classification,
    usual service conditions, rating, temperature rise, abnormal conditions, efficiency,
    overspeed, telephone influence factor, tests, direction of rotation, name plate
    marking, and performance specification forms.
