    <abstract>A data model to support the interchange of data elements and their values between a content object and a runtime service (RTS) is described in this standard. This standard is based on a current industry practice called “computer managed instruction” (CMI). The work on which this standard is based was developed to support a client–server environment in which a learning technology system, generically called a “learning management system” (LMS), delivers digital content, called “content objects,” to learners. The data model supports learner data and preferences; interactions; objectives; content-object entry, exit, and status information; time parameters; and scores.</abstract>
