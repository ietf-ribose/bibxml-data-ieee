    <abstract>The following topics were dealt with: The supplement contains errata, corrections, and clarifications to IEEE Std 896.5-1993. Futurebus+/sup TM/ standards provide system developers with a set of tools with which high performance bus-based systems may be developed. This architecture provides a wide range of performance scalability over both cost and time for multiple generations of single- and multiple-bus multiprocessor systems. This document, a companion standard to ISO/IEC 10857:1994 [ANSI/IEEE Std 896.1, 1994 Edition], builds on the logical layer by adding requirements for three military profiles. It is to these profiles that products will claim conformance.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
