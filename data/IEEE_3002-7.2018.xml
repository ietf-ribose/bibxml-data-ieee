    <abstract>Activities related to motor-starting studies, including design considerations for new systems, analytical studies for existing systems, as well as operational and model-validation considerations for industrial and commercial power systems are described. Motor-starting analysis includes evaluation of motor-starting current and voltage drop. Accuracy of calculation results primarily relies on system modeling assumptions and methods used. The use of computer-aided analysis software, with a list of desirable capabilities recommended to conduct a modern motor-starting study, is emphasized. Examples of system data requirements and result-analysis techniques are presented. Benefits obtained from motor-starting studies are discussed, and various types of computer-aided motor-starting studies are examined. Data or information required for these studies, as well as the expected results of a motor-starting study effort, are also reviewed.</abstract>
