    <abstract>A recommended practice for the design and operation of electric systems in health care facilities is provided. The term health care facility as used here encompasses buildings or parts of buildings that contain hospitals, nursing homes, residential custodial care facilities, clinics, ambulatory health care centers, and medical and dental offices. Buildings or parts of buildings within an industrial or commercial complex, used as medical facilities, logically fall within the scope of this recommended practice.</abstract>
