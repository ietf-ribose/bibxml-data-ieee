    <abstract>This standard defines an extensible IEEE 802(R) media access independent services framework (i.e., function and protocol) that enables the optimization of services including handover and other services when performed between heterogeneous IEEE 802 networks. It also facilitates these services when networking between IEEE 802 networks and Cellular networks.</abstract>
