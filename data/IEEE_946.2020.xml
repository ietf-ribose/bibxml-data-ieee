    <abstract>Recommended practices for the design of dc power systems for stationary applications are provided in this document. The components of the dc power system addressed by this document include lead-acid and nickel-cadmium storage batteries, static battery chargers, and distribution equipment. Guidance in selecting the quantity and types of equipment, the equipment ratings, interconnections, instrumentation and protection is also provided. This recommendation is applicable for power generation, substation, and telecommunication applications.</abstract>
