    <abstract>Superseded by IEEE Std 802.3-2002 Necessary changes and additions are made to provide for an additional, full duplex mode of operation on a speed-independent basis. Changes are made to the MAC and selected Physical Layer implementations (10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL, 100BASE-T) to support full duplex. A mechanism for pause-based flow control is also added.p&gt; Abstract 802.3y: Changes and additions to the 100BASE-T portion of IEEE Std 802.3 are provided to specify an additional 100 Mb/s transceiver type 100BASE-T, which can support full duplex operation over two pairs of Category 3 or better cabling.</abstract>
