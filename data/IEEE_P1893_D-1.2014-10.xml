    <abstract>In this guide, field testing methodology and techniques are presented for measuring DC transmission line and earth electrode line parameters. The topics to be addressed will include basic requirements of the measurement; safety cautions; requirements for test instruments; testing induced voltage and current; verifying the polarity and testing insulation resistance; measuring DC resistance; measuring impedance frequency characteristic; reviewing various factors that can distort measurements.</abstract>
