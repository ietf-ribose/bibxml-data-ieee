    <abstract>Formal software interfaces to system diagnosis tools and applications are defined. As part of the AI-ESTATE set of standards, this standard defines services to manipulate information models as defined in IEEE Std 1232.1-1997 and to control a diagnostic reasoner. This standard includes a new information model to manipulate dynamic information obtained during the process of system diagnosis. Service bindings to ANSI C and ANSI Ada are also provided.</abstract>
