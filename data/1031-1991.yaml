abstract:
  content: Superseded by 1031-2000. Guidelines for the application, protection, and
    ratings of equipment for the safe and reliable utilization of shunt power capacitors
    are provided. This guide applies to the use of 50 and 60 Hz shunt power capacitors
    rated 2400 Vac and above, and assemblies of capacitors. Applications that range
    from simple unit utilization to complex bank situations are covered.
