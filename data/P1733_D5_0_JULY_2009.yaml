abstract:
  content: This standard specifies the protocol, data encapsulations, connection management
    1 and presentation time procedures used to ensure interoperability between audio
    and video based 2 end stations that use standard networking services provided
    by all IEEE 802 networks meeting 3 QoS requirements for time-sensitive applications
    by leveraging the Real-time Transport Protocol 4 (RTP) family of protocols and
    IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocols.
