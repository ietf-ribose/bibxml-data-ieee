    <abstract>This standard applies to power-line carrier line-tuning equipment connected between the coupling capacitors and power-line carrier transmitter/receiver terminals operating in the frequency range of 30 to 500 kHz over power transmission lines and cables or to similar line-tuning equipment in a carrier bypass. Power-line carrier line-tuning equipment includes assemblies and components: tuning inductor, impedance matching transformer, balancing transformer, tuning capacitor, inductance-capacitance (LC) tuning unit, hybrid, filter, protective unit, interconnecting cables and enclosure. This standard includes the protective devices that facilitate the safe operation and maintenance of the line tuning components under normal and usual operating conditions. This standard will develop technical definitions, performance ratings, testing methods, and manufacturing requirements for the included line-tuning equipment.</abstract>
