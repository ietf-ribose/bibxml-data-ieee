abstract:
  content: This recommended practice provides information to assist 1 in sizing the
    array and battery of a stand-alone photovoltaic system. Systems considered in
    this recommended practice consist of PV as the only power source and a battery
    for energy storage. These systems also commonly employ controls to protect the
    battery from being over- or undercharged, and may employ a power conversion subsystem
    (inverter or converter). This recommended practice is applicable to all stand-alone
    PV systems where PV is the only charging source. This recommended practice does
    not include PV hybrid systems nor grid connected systems. This recommended practice
    covers lead-acid batteries only; nickel-cadmium and other battery types are not
    included. This recommended practice does not include the sizing of the system
    controller, inverter, wiring, or other system components.
