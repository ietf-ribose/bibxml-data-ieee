    <abstract>This standard documents information needed to initiate, plan, execute, monitor and control, and close a single project, and identifies those project management processes that have been recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time. With the third edition, the PMBOK Guide became an ANSI standard in 2004. It is used internationally for training and certification of project managers.
