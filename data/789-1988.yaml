abstract:
  content: The standard applies to wires and cables, used principally for power system
    communications and control purposes, which are located within electric power stations
    or are installed within the zone of influence of the power station ground potential
    rise (GPR), or which may be buried adjacent to electric power transmission and
    distribution lines. They may be subjected to high voltages either by conduction
    or induction coupling, or both. Such voltages are often higher than the insulation
    withstand capability of ordinary telephone-type cables, which are frequently used
    for such purposes. The standard covers the appropriate design requirements, electrical
    and mechanical parameters, the testing requirements, and the handling procedures
    for cables that are to be installed and operated in high voltage environments.
    Coaxial and fiber optic cables are specifically excluded from this standard. The
    objective of this standard is to specify a cable that may be used to ensure the
    overall reliability of communications and control cables in high voltage environments.
