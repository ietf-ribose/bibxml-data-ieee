abstract:
  content: IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015 defines the protocol and compatible interconnection
    for data communication devices using low-data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity
    short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network
    (WPAN). A variety of physical layers (PHYs) have been defined that cover a wide
    variety of frequency bands.
