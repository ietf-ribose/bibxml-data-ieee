abstract:
  content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.12.01-2005 Electrical, mechanical, and safety
    requirements of ventilated, nonventilated, and sealed dry-type distribution and
    power transformers or autotransformers, single and polyphase, with a voltage of
    601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding, are described. Information that
    can be used as a basis for the establishment of performance, interchangeability,
    and safety requirements of equipment described, and for assistance in the proper
    selection of such equipment, is given.
