    <abstract>Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution and power class expulsion, current-limiting, and combination-type external capacitor fuses and accessories, with rated voltages from 1 kV through 38 kV, for protecting shunt capacitors complying with IEEE Std 18-2002 and NEMA CP 1-2000, are established in this standard. All of these devices are intended for use on AC systems. These fuses may be used with capacitor units, groups of units, or entire capacitor banks.</abstract>
