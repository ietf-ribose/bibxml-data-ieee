    <abstract>Elements and commonly used components in excitation control systems and for excitation systems as applied to synchronous machines are defined. The primary purpose of the standard is to provide a vocabulary for writing excitation systems specifications, evaluating excitation system performance, specifying methods for excitation system tests, and preparing excitation system standards. It is also intended to serve as an educational aid for those becoming acquainted with excitation systems.</abstract>
