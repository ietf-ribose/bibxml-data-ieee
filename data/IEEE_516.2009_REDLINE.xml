    <abstract>This guide provides the general recommendations for performing maintenance work on energized power lines. It is not intended to include all of the proven practical methods and procedures, however, these selected comprehensive recommendations are based on sound engineering principles, engineering safety considerations, and field experience by many utilities. Included are technical explanations as required to cover certain laboratory testing of tools and equipment, in-service inspection, maintenance and care of tools and equipment, and work methods of the maintenance of energized lines for persons working in vicinity of power lines.</abstract>
