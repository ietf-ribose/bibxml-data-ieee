    <abstract>Vented lead-acid (VLA), valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd - both fully vented and partially-recombinant types), and Li-ion stationary battery installations are discussed in this guide, written to serve as a bridge between the electrical designer and the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) designer. Ventilation of stationary battery installations is critical to improving battery life while reducing the hazards associated with hydrogen production (hydrogen production is not a concern with Li-ion under normal operating conditions [it is under thermal runaway conditions]). This guide describes battery operating modes and the hazards associated with each. It provides the HVAC designer with the information to provide a cost effective ventilation solution.</abstract>
