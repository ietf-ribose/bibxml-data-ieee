abstract:
  content: The guide is to aid wire and cable manufacturers in the study of smoke
    generation characteristics of materials used in products. The two test methods
    looked at are the NBS method, where measurement is made of the attenuation of
    a light beam by the smoke, and the Arapahoe method, where smoke and char are measured
    gravimetrically under dynamic conditions.<<ETX>>
