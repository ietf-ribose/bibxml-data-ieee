    <abstract>A comprehensive guide to practical line current differential schemes using digital communications. Operating principles, synchronization methods, channel requirements, current transformer requirements, external time reference requirements, backup considerations, testing considerations, and troubleshooting are included. This guide also provides specific guidelines for various application aspects including multi-terminal lines, series compensated lines, mutually coupled lines, line charging current, in-zone transformers and reactors, single-phase tripping and reclosing, as well as communications channel requirements.</abstract>
