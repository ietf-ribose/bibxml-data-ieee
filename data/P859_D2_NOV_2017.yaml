abstract:
  content: 'Terminology and indices for reporting and analyzing outage occurrences
    of transmission facilities are defined in this standard. Outage definitions and
    indices are given for two general types of facilities: units and components. Units
    are functional facilities that transfer power between designated points, while
    components are specific pieces of equipment. Outage definitions are given both
    for describing the outage history of a particular facility and for describing
    groups of individual outage occurrences that are related in some way.'
