    <abstract>The interfaces between and among functional systems on rail 1 rapid transit vehicles are prescribed. The systems themselves are treated as "black boxes;" requirements for the input signals and the output response are given. For each category of interface, three types are listed in increasing technical sophistication.</abstract>
