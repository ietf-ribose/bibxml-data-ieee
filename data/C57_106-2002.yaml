  content: 'This IEEE Standards product is part of the C57 family on Power Distribution
    and Regulating Transformers. Abstract: Recommendations regarding oil tests and
    evaluation procedures are made in this guide;references are made to methods of
    reconditioning and reclaiming conventional petroleum (mineral) dielectric insulating
    oils;the levels at which these methods become necessary; and the routines for
    restoring oxidation resistance, where required, by the addition of oxidation inhibitors.
    The intent is to assist the power equipment operator in evaluating the serviceability
    of oil received in equipment, oil as received from the supplier for lling new
    equipment at the installation site, and oil as processed into such equipment;
    and to assist the operator in maintaining oil in serviceable condition. The mineral
    oil covered is used in transformers, reactors, circuit breakers, load tap changers,
    and voltage regulators. Keywords :insulation testing , load tap changers , oil
    circuit breakers , oil insulation , power distribution maintenance , power transformer
    insulation , reactors , transformers , voltage regulators , IEEE C57.106'
