abstract:
  content: Re-launching one of the most valuable tools for Nuclear design engineers.
    To ensure that original equipment design is preserved and full regulatory compliance
    is met, itâ€™s vital that you implement the correct set of NRC regulations and guides
    and industry standards. In short, to do your job efficiently and effectively,
    you need easy and immediate access to the most complete information on nuclear
    equipment qualification. This set contains the most complete information on nuclear
    equipment qualification, including NRC bulletins and notices, federal rules and
    IEEE EQ standards and recommended practices.
