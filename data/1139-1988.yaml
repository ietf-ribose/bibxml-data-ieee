abstract:
  content: This standard covers the fundamental metrology for describing physical
    quantities of importance to frequency and time metrology. Quantities covered are
    frequency instability, phase instability, spectral densities, time instability
    variances, time prediction, and confidence limits when estimating the variance
    from a finite data set. In addition, recommendations are made for the reporting
    of measurements of frequency and phase instabilities, especially regarding the
    recording of experimental parameters, experimental conditions and calculation
    techniques. This standard also covers translation between the frequency domain
    and time domain terminology and provides an extensive bibliography of the relevant
    literature.<<ETX>>
