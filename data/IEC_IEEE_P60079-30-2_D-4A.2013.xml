    <abstract>This part of IEC 60079 provides guidance for the application of electrical resistance trace heating systems in areas where explosive gas atmospheres may be present, with the exception of those classified as zone 0. It provides recommendations for the design, installation, maintenance and repair of trace heating equipment and associated control and monitoring equipment. It does not cover devices that operate by induction heating, skin effect heating or direct pipeline heating, nor those intended for stress relieving. This part supplements the requirements specified in IEC 60079-30-1.</abstract>
