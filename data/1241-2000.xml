    <abstract>IEEE Std 1241-2000 identifies analog-to-digital converter (ADC) error sources and provides test methods with which to perform the required error measurements. The information in this standard is useful both to manufacturers and to users of ADCs in that it provides a basis for evaluating and comparing existing devices, as well as providing a template for writing specifications for the procurement of new ones. In some applications, the information provided by the tests described in this standard can be used to correct ADC errors, e.g., correction for gain and offset errors. This standard also presents terminology and definitions to aid the user in defining and testing ADCs.</abstract>
