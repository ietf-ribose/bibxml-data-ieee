    <abstract>This standard defines a method for exchange of synchronized phasor measurement data between power system equipment. It specifies messaging including types, use, contents, and data formats for real-time communication between Phasor Measurement Units (PMU), Phasor Data Concentrators (PDC), and other applications.</abstract>
