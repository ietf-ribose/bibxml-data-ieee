    <abstract>The evolution of the harmonized set of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288-12207 related standards and technical reports that are discussed in this International Standardprovides detailed requirements and guidance on the application of system life cycle processes. This International Standard unifies technical and managementrequirements and guidance from several of these sources to specify the requirements for the content of a SEMP and to provide a common SEMP format. This International Standard also identifies the processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 to perform the necessary project planning activities to accomplish the project's technical effort and to develop the project's SEMP. Due to close alignment with the content of ISO/IEC 24748, ISO/IEC 26702 is now Part 4 of the multi-part International Standard, ISO/IEC 24748 (Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle management).</abstract>
