abstract:
- content: Tests and measurements that are performed on shielded power cables to identify
    the location of a fault are described. Whenever possible, the limitations of a
    particular test and measurement to locate a fault are provided and recommendations
    are made regarding specialized fault-locating techniques. A fault characterization
    chart is included as an aid to select a fault-locating technique.
