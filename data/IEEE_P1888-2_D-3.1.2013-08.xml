    <abstract>This standard describes heterogeneous networks convergence and scalability, specifies the requirements of networks convergence, extends the system architecture defined in IEEE 1888 Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network with two new IEEE 1888 components, i.e., Reconfigurable Resolution Server (RRS) and Intelligent Application Resolver (IAR), generalizes primitive data type expressions and explicit field-bus data type management in IEEE 1888 system. This standard enables IEEE 1888 system to interoperate with heterogeneous access networks efficiently and improves the efficiency, flexibility, scalability and manageability of IEEE 1888 system</abstract>
