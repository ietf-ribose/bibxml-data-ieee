    <abstract>This standard specifies procedures, managed objects, and protocols for bridges and end systems that provide identification and replication of packets for redundant transmission, identification of duplicate packets, and elimination of duplicate packets. It is not concerned with the creation of the multiple paths over which the duplicates are transmitted. (The PDF of this standard is available at no cost at http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.1CB-2017.html)</abstract>
