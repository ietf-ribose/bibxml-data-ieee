    <abstract>The Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) can improve interoperability, reduce thecost of using Intellectual Property (IP) for new projects or electronic design automation (EDA) tools, and make it easier to reuse verification components. Overall, using this standard will lowerverification costs and improve design quality throughout the industry. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementors of the UVM class library, the implementors of tools supporting the class library, and the users of the class library.</abstract>
