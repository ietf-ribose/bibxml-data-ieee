    <abstract>This project will develop a Guide for the application of protective relays used for load shedding and restoration during electric power system abnormal frequency conditions. It will present background information, bibliography, and recommendations. It discusses abnormal frequency power system behavior, existing load shedding and restoration practices, the abnormal frequency function of typical protective relays, and possible new methods for improved load shedding and restoration. This project is limited to electric power system applications and will not include Abnormal Frequency Protection of Power Generating Plants.</abstract>
