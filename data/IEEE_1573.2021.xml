    <abstract>A technical basis for implementation of electronic power subsystems is provided in this recommended practice. It is intended for electronic systems engineers and integrators, electronic power subsystem designers and integrators, as well as for power element manufacturers and suppliers. System-level issues in element or subsystem integration, adaptation, and accommodation are addressed, and system interface parameters, test methods, and test conditions are defined. Ac–dc, dc-ac, and dc–dc electronic power subsystems are discussed. The range of electronic power subsystems includes those with dc, single-phase, and three-phase inputs, having power levels from a fraction of a watt up to 20 kW. The voltage range is 600 V and below at a frequency or frequencies of dc 1 kHz. Internal operating frequencies within elements or subsystems may be much higher than 1 kHz. This recommended practice may be used outside the range where applicable. IEEE Std 1515-2000 is built on and supplemented in this document.</abstract>
