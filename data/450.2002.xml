    <abstract>Maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life and performance of permanently installed, vented lead-acid storage batteries used for standby power applications are provided. This recommended practice also provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. This recommended practice is applicable to full-float stationary applications where a charger maintains the battery fully charged and supplies the dc loads.</abstract>
