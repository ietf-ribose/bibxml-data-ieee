    <abstract>Wearable Consumer Electronic Devices (Wearables) are given an overview, terminology, and categorization in this standard. An architecture for a series of standard specifications that define technical requirements and testing methods for different aspects of wearables--from basic security and suitableness of wear to various functional areas, such as health, fitness, and infotainment--is further outlined.</abstract>
