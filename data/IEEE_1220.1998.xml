    <abstract>Superseded by 1220-2005 The interdisciplinary tasks, which are required throughout a system√ïs life cycle to trans-form customer needs, requirements, and constraints into a system solution, are defined. In addition,the requirements for the systems engineering process and its application throughout the productlife cycle are specified. The focus of this standard is on engineering activities necessary to guideproduct development while ensuring that the product is properly designed to make it affordable toproduce, own, operate, maintain, and eventually to dispose of, without undue risk to health or theenvironment.</abstract>
