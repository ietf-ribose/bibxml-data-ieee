    <abstract>This IEEE Standards product is part of the 802 family on LAN/MAN. Abstract: The lower transport layers [(Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP), Link Manager Protocol (LMP), baseband, and radio] of the Bluetoothâ„¢ wireless technology are defined. Bluetooth is an industry specification for short-range radio frequency (RF)-based connectivity for portable personal devices. The IEEE 802.15.1 Task Group has reviewed and provided a standard adaptation of the Bluetooth specifications (version 1.1) medium access control (MAC) (L2CAP, LMP, and baseband) and physical layer (PHY) (radio). Also specified is a clause on service access points (SAPs), which includes a logical link control (LLC)-MAC interface for the ISO/IEC 8802-2 LLC. A normative annex is included that provides a Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma, and an informative high-level behavioral ITU-T Z.100 specification and description language (SDL) model for an integrated Bluetooth MAC sublayer are also specified.</abstract>
