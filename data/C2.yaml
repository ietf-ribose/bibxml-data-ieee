- content: This Preprint provides the full text of each change proposal (CP) to revise
    the 2017 Edition of the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) together with the
    initial recommendation of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction of the rule addressed
    by the CP. The purpose of the NESC 2022 Preprint is to solicit public comment
    for each of the CPs and initial Subcommittee actions. The public comment period
    is 1 July 2019 to 1 March 2020. Subcommittees will consider the original change
