    <abstract>In this IEEE Standard a test method is provided to qualify various essentially nonvolatile, highly viscous fluids or solid materials at 90/spl deg/C, for use with high-voltage cable shields and jackets. A suggested alternative test method for more fluid and more volatile materials is also provided.</abstract>
