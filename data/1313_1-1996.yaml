abstract:
  content: In this IEEE standard the procedure for selection of the withstand voltages
    for equipment phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase insulation systems is specified.
    A list of standard insulation levels, based on the voltage stress to which the
    equipment is being exposed, is also identified. This standard applies to three-phase
    AC systems above 1 kV.
