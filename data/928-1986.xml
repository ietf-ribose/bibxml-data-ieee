    <abstract>The purpose is to establish the general performance criteria for terrestrial photovoltaic power systems and to provide an overall framework for all detailed terrestrial photovoltaic power system performance standards. It also provides recommendations for criteria regarding subsystem performance and standard test methods to be used for performance measurements. Since thermal conditioning elements may be part of the system design, some consideration of the thermal subsystem is included.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
