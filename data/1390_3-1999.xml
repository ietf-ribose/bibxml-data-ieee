    <abstract>The telephone network interface to a utility controller operating under the utility telemetry service architecture is described. The interface is described in terms of a utility meter reading application but any enhanced service provider communication can be transported. Telemetry calls may be initiated by either the utility/service provider (outbound) or the telemetry interface unit (TIU)/CPE (inbound) on the end user's premises.</abstract>
