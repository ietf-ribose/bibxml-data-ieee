    <abstract>The purposes of this Standard are: to document the minimum information that users of general-purpose laboratory cathode-ray oscilloscopes typically need; to provide potential purchasers and others with a common means for making comparisons between instruments; and to provide uniformity of information from manufacturers. This Standard applies primarily to general-purpose laboratory cathode-ray oscilloscopes; it does not necessarily apply to specific kinds of oscilloscopes, such as those employing sampling techniques, nor to storage oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, television monitors, or other instruments using cathode-ray tube displays.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
