    <abstract>Procedures for testing and evaluating the performance of switchgear for internal arcing faults is covered. A method of identifying the capabilities of this equipment is given. Service conditions, installation, and application of equipment are also discussed. As used in this document, the term switchgear is used as a general term covering switching and interrupting devices and their combination with associated control, instrumentation, metering, protective and regulating devices, assemblies of those devices with associated interconnections, accessories, and supporting structures used primarily in conjunction with the generation, transmission, distribution, and conversion of electrical power.</abstract>
