    <abstract>A suggested outline for information that should be included in a design criteria for overhead transmission lines is presented in this guide. This guide is not a design criteria or a design manual, it is a listing of the information that is required during the design of a transmission line, and provides guidance for line designers in the collection and documentation of how the line was designed; including the sources of information used in design and the design approach used.</abstract>
