    <abstract>A technique for the quantification of the activity of identified radionuclides, using any of a variety of ionization chambers currently available for this purpose, is presented. Application of the standard is limited to instruments that incorporate well-type ionization chambers as detectors. The method provides measurements that are accurate to within plus or minus 10% and reproducible to within plus or minus 5%. The standard is also intended to ensure continuing performance of the apparatus within these specifications.</abstract>
