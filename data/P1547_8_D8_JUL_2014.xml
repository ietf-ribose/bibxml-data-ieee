  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This document provides approaches for the application of distributed resources (DR) interconnected with the grid starting from the IEEE 1547 (including 1547a) requirements, but then considering the application of DR based on an overall system-wide, DR-system integration basis. IEEE 1547 was established based on its requirements being satisfied at the PCC, but 1547.8 additionally addresses DR interconnection considerations beyond the PCC. This 1547.8 document provides recommendations addressing DR interconnection system-level potential adverse effects, and, opportunities for EPS improvement, considering: the DR technology capabilities, interconnection technology capabilities, operations of the DR, operations of the area EPS, operations of the Local EPS, effects on power quality (voltage and frequency concerns), DR interconnection response to abnormal Area EPS conditions (e.g., voltage, frequency, faults), advanced capabilities of DR functions for supporting Area EPS operations, and, potential for DR to increase reliability and efficiency of electricity delivery and grid operations.
