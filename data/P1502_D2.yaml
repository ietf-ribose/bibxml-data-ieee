abstract:
  content: This standard will write a standard practices guide for the measurement
    of radar cross section. This guide will discuss RCS measurement practices as they
    relate to indoor and outdoor measurement in an established range. It will not
    discuss measurement of foliage, natural events, etc. It will also not discuss
    near field measurement and other specialty measurements.
