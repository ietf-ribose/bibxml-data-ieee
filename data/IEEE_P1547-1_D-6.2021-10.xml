    <abstract>A method to validate computational electromagnetics computer modeling and simulation techniques, codes, and models is defined in this standard. It is applicable to a wide variety of electromagnetic applications including, but not limited to, the fields of electromagnetic compatibility, radar cross section, signal integrity, and antennas. Validation of a particular solution data set can be achieved by comparison to the data set obtained by measurements, alternate codes, canonical, or analytic methods.</abstract>
