    <abstract>Terms, test methods, test circuits, measurement 1 procedures and preferred result values for the surge mitigation parameters of isolating transformers used in networking devices and equipment is set in this standard. Three types of isolating transformer are considered; mains low frequency power, high frequency power (switching mode power supplies) and signal (e.g.Ethernet data).</abstract>
