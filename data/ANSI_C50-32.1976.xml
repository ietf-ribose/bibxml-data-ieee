    <abstract>Useful methods for the evaluation of systems of insulation for random-wound stators of rotating electric machines are given. The chief purpose is to classify insulation systems in accordance with their temperature limits by test, rather than by chemical composition. The procedure is intended to evaluate insulation systems for use in usual service conditions with air cooling. It has also been a useful tool for evaluating systems for special requirements where machines are enclosed in gas atmospheres, subjected to strong chemicals, metal dusts, or submersion in liquids, although these special requirements are beyond the scope of this test procedure.</abstract>
