  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">Information on the application of underfrequency load shedding and restoration to ac power systems is compiled in this guide. Various system conditions that may require the use of underfrequency load shedding and the application of protective relays to various methods of performing underfrequency load shedding are described in this guide. Some practical examples of underfrequency load shedding applications are also provided.</abstract>
