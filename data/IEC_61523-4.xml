    <abstract>A method is provided for specifying power intent for an electronic design, for use inverification of the structure and behavior of the design in the context of a given power managementarchitecture, and for driving implementation of that power management architecture. The methodsupports incremental refinement of power intent specifications required for IP-based design flows.</abstract>
