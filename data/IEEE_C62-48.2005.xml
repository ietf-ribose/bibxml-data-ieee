    <abstract>Information is provided to users and manufacturers of surge-protective devices (SPIDs) about the interactions that can occur between SPIDs and power system disturbances. This guide applies to SPIDs manufactured to be connected to 50 Hz or 60 Hz ac power circuits rated at 100-1000 V rms. The effects of the presence and operation of SPIDs on the quality of power available to the connected loads are described. The interaction between multiple SPIDs on the same circuit is also described</abstract>
