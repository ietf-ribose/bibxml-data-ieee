    <abstract>Draft IEEE PC95.3.1-200X recommends techniques and instrumentation for the measurement and computation of electric, magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) fields in the near field of an electromagnetic field source. This Draft Recommended Practice provides descriptions of the concepts, techniques, and instruments that can be applied to the measurement of the electric and magnetic fields in an environment and the currents induced in the human body by these fields. Techniques for determining the current density and the electric field strength within the human body are discussed. This Draft Recommended Practice is intended primarily for use by engineers, biophysicists, and other specialists who are familiar with basic electromagnetic (EM) field theory and practice, and the potential hazards associated with EM fields. It will be most useful to bioeffects researchers, instrumentation developers and manufacturers, those developing calibration systems and standards, and persons involved in critical hazard assessments or hazard surveys.</abstract>
