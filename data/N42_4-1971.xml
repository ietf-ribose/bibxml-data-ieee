    <abstract>Coaxial high-voltage connectors on nuclear instruments for DC applications up to 5000 V and AC applications up to 3500 V rms at 60 Hz are covered. The connectors may also be used at higher frequencies provided the operating voltage is appropriately reduced to provide for interchangeability of safe high-voltage connectors in nuclear instrument applications. The connectors are safe in that the pin and socket contacts are well and securely recessed in the connector housing so that hand or body contact of the unmated connector with rated voltage applied will not result in electrical shock.
