    <abstract>The methods and requirements for qualifying switchgear assemblies for indoor areas outside of the containment in nuclear power generating stations are described in this document. These assemblies include: metal-enclosed low-voltage power circuit breaker switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.1(TM); metal-clad switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.2(TM); metal-enclosed bus, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.23(TM); and metal-enclosed interrupter switchgear assemblies, as defi ned in IEEE Std C37.20.3(TM).</abstract>
