    <abstract>ANSI/IEEE Std 323-1984, IEEE Standard for Qualifying Class IE Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, was developed to provide qualification requirements for Class IE (safety-related) electrical equipments that would confirm the adequacy of such equipments to perform their safety functions on a continuing basis throughout their installed life. This document is based on ANSI/IEEE Std 323-1983 and is intended to present specific qualification procedures for switchgear assemblies in Class IE application.</abstract>
