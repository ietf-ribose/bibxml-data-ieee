    <abstract>The purpose of these definitions is to foster uniformity and standardization of language among engineers engaged in reporting, analyzing, and predicting outages of transmission and distribution facilities and interruptions to customers. While the proposed definitions are not intended to be specific instructions for reporting outages of facilities and interruptions to customers, use of standardized definitions should facilitate exchanges of data between workers in the field. The preparation of standard definitions of terms may be regarded as a first step before pooling of data between utilities can be successfully accomplished. The work of preparing this publication was carried out by a task force of the System Operations Subcommittee of the Power System Engineering Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society.</abstract>
