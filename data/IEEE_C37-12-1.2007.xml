    <abstract>This Guide provides a recommended table of contents for high-voltage circuit breaker instruction manuals. The Guide provides a listing of information that will help a knowledgeable user receive, install, commission, operate, and maintain circuit breakers. Recommended additional material is described in clause 5 for circuit breakers that are intended for high-voltage, free-standing installations. Drawout circuit breakers used in switchgear are excluded from Clause 5 requirements. Circuit breakers used in Gas Insulated Switchgear installations are excluded from this guide. This Guide in no way replaces the manufacturerâ€™s instruction manual which is to be used for safe and effective utilization of the circuit breaker. This Guide helps organize instruction manual information in a consistent and user friendly manner.</abstract>
