    <abstract>The performance and functional capability requirements for DER connected with the Area Electric Power Systems (Area EPS) are defined in IEEE Std 1547(TM). This amendment revises the ranges of allowable trip clearing time settings in Table 13 for DERs in abnormal operating performance category III to allow wider ranges that can broaden and simplify the adoption of the standard. In addition, the related informative Figure H.9 is revised accordingly.</abstract>
