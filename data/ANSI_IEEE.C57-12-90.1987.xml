    <abstract>Superseded by C57.12.90-1987. Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00-1993, IEEE Standard General Requirements for Liquid-Immersed Distribution, Power, and Regulating Transformers, and other standards applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers are described. Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. This standard covers resistance measurement, polarity and phase-relation tests, ratio tests, no-load-loss and excitation current measurements, impedance and loadloss measurements, dielectric tests, temperature tests, short-circuit tests, and audible-sound-level measurements.</abstract>
