    <abstract>The basic requirements to be met by series connected, solid-state, self-restoring overcurrent protectors (OCPs) for the protection of telecommunication equipment and lines are presented. This standard should be used for the harmonization of existing or future specifications issued by solid-state, self-restoring OCP manufacturers, telecommunication equipment manufacturers, administrations, or network operators.</abstract>
