    <abstract>The Dataway defined in IEEE Std 583-1975, Modular Instrumentation and Digital Interface System, is the basis for all CAMAC* systems. It provides the means of interconnection between modules and a crate controller within one crate. This standard defines the CAMAC Parallel Highway Interface System for interconnecting up to seven CAMAC crates (or other devices) and a system controller. The Parallel Highway, so called because the data bits are transmitted along the Highway in parallel, is capable of handling higher data rates than nonparallel highways. However, in some applications, for example, where there are long distances between crates or where simplicity of interconnections is particularly important, the Serial Highway of IEEE Std 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface System (CAMAC), may be more suitable.This standard defines the signals, timing, and logical organization of the connections from crate controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers to the Parallel Highway through a standard connector. The internal structures of crate controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers, and the physical construction of the Parallel Highway System are defined only where they affect compatibility between parts of the system.</abstract>
