    <abstract>This amendment provides corrections and optimizations to IEEE Std 802.15.3-2003. The management service access points (SAPs) have been completely updated to create a consistent, logical interface. As a consequence, most of the message sequence charts (MSCs) in the medium access control (MAC) functional specification have been updated as well. Channel time usage is more efficient with the addition of multiple contention periods, releasing channel time, implied acknowledgment, and mullticast groups. (The PDF of this standard is available at no cost.</abstract>
