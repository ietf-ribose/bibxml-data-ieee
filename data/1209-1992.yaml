abstract:
  content: Adminstratively withdrawn 1999. The evaluation and selection of CASE tools
    supporting software engineering processes, including project management processes,
    predevelopment processes, development processes, postdevelopment processes, and
    integral processes, are addressed. The evaluation and selection processes recommended
    are based upon the perspective of a CASE tool user. Therefore, the evaluation
    and selection criteria address only program characteristics visible to the user,
    such as program inputs and outputs, program function, user interfaces, and documented
    external program interfaces.
