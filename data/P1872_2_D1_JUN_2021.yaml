abstract:
  content: This standard extends IEEE 1872-2015 Standard for Ontologies for Robotics
    and Automation to represent additional domain-specific concepts, definitions,
    and axioms commonly used in Autonomous Robotics (AuR). This standard is general
    and can be used in many ways - for example, to specify the domain knowledge needed
    to unambiguously describe the design patterns of AuR systems, to represent AuR
    system architectures in a unified way, or as a guideline to build autonomous systems
    consisting of robots operating in various environments.
