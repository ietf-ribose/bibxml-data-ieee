    <abstract>This document contains provisions for the processes and products related to the engineering of requirements for systems and software products and services throughout the life cycle. It defines the construct of a good requirement, provides attributes and characteristics of requirements, and discusses the iterative and recursive application of requirements processes throughout the life cycle. This document provides additional guidance in the application of requirements engineering and management processes for requirements-related activities in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288. Information items applicable to the engineering of requirements and their content are defined. The content of this document can be added to the existing set of requirements-related life cycle processes defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, or can be used independently.</abstract>
