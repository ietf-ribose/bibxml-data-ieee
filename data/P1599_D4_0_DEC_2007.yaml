abstract:
  content: This recommended practice is aimed at developing an XML-based application
    which defines a standardlanguage for symbolic music representation. The language
    is a metarepresentation of music information to describe, link and synchronize
    music information within a multi-layered environment. The purpose is achieving
    integration among symbolic, structural, notational, computer performance, and
    digital sound levels of representation. Furthermore, the proposed standard should
    integrate music representation with already defined and accepted common standards.
    This standard should be supported by any kind of software dealing with music information,
    e.g. applications for score editing, Optical Music Recognition (OMR), music performance,
    multimedia databases, computer-aided composition and musicological research.
