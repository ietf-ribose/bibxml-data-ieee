    <abstract>The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide a small wind energy conversion system (SWECS) user, owner, or installer with interface guidelines and operating procedures necessary to connect and operate a SWECS in parallel with an electric utility system. It contains application guidelines and procedures for the interconnection and compatible operation of a SWECS with electric utilities. It addresses the interface between the wind system and the utility and the factors relating to equipment protection, power quality, and the safety of operating personnel and the general public.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx></abstract>
