    <abstract>Secure message formats, and the processing of those secure messages, within the DSRC/WAVE system are defined. The standard covers methods for securing WAVE management messages and application messages, with the exception of vehicle-originating safety messages. It also describes administrative functions necessary to support the core security functions.</abstract>
