abstract:
  content: "(Amendment of IEEE Std 802.3Â¿-2008). The scope of this project is to augment
    the capabilities of the IEEE Std 802.3 standard with higher power levels and improved
    power management information. The project will augment the methodology for the
    provision of power via balanced cabling to connected Data Terminal Equipment with
    802.3 interfaces. Optional augmented power limit will be made available for certain
    structured cabling systems. Compatibility with existing equipment will be maintained.
    Purpose: The purpose of the proposed project is to include higher power applications
    while providing enhanced power management information to reduce total system cost."
