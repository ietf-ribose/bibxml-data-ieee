    <abstract>Recommendations to protect personnel in military environments against established adverse health effects associated with exposure to electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields, induced and contact current, and contact and arcing voltages over the frequency range of 0 Hz to 300 GHz are provided in this standard. IEEE Std C95.1-2345(TM) was developed to replace NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 2345 (Edition 3), Evaluation and Control of Personnel Exposure to Radio Frequency Fields3 kHz to 300 GHz, (13 February 2003).</abstract>
