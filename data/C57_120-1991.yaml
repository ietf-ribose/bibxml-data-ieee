abstract:
  content: A method for establishing the dollar value of the electric power needed
    to supply the losses of a transformer or reactor is provided. Users can use this
    loss evaluation to determine the relative economic benefit of a high-first-cost,
    low-loss unit versus one with a lower first cost and higher losses, and to compare
    the offerings of two or more manufacturers to aid in making the best purchase
    choice. Manufacturers can use the evaluation to optimize the design and provide
    the most economically unit to bid and manufacture. The various types of losses
    are reviewed.
