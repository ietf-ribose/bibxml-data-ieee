    <abstract>The interdisciplinary tasks that are required throughout a system's life cycle to transform stakeholder needs, requirements, and constraints into a system solution are defined. This standard is intended to guide the development of systems for commercial, government, military, and space applications. The information applies to a project within an enterprise that is responsible for developing a product design and establishing the life cycle infrastructure needed to provide for life cycle sustainment.</abstract>
