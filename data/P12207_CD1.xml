    <abstract>IEEE previously adopted ISO/IEC 12207 as IEEE 12207.0. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 is now revising the document that we adopted. This project will permit IEEE to provide comments to the revision and adopt the result. The scope of the document is substantively unchanged from the previous version: This International Standard establishes a common framework for software life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by the software industry. It contains processes, activities, and tasks that are to be applied during the acquisition of a software product or service and during the supply, development, operation, and maintenance of software products. Software includes the software portion of firmware.</abstract>
