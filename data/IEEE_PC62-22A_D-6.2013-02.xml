    <abstract>This guide covers the application of metal-oxide surge arresters to safeguard electric power equipment, with a nominal operating voltage 1000 V and above, against the hazards of abnormally high-voltage surges of various origins. This guide provides information on the characteristics of metal-oxide surge arresters and the protection of substation equipment, distribution systems, overhead lines, and large electrical machines.</abstract>
