    <abstract>An approach to preparing a functional specification for a unified power flow controller (UPFC) using modular multilevel converter (MMC) is documented by this guide. This guide provides the functional requirements for UPFC project application, including UPFC system composition, function and performance requirements, primary equipment requirements, control and protection requirements, characteristic description, spares, engineering studies, testing, documentation, as well as training of UPFC projects. The intention of this document is to serve as a base specification with an informative annex provided to guide utilities, manufacturers, integrators, and other interested entities to apply a particular UPFC project.</abstract>
