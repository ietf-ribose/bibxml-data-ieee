abstract:
  content: This standard covers the application of gapped silicon-carbide surge arresters
    to safeguard electric power equipment against the hazards of abnormally high voltage
    surges of various origins. Such overvoltages may cause flashovers and serious
    damage to equipment, thereby jeopardizing the supply of power to users. It is
    essential to prevent this by the proper coordination of surge protection devices
    with the insulation strength of the protected equipment.<<ETX>>
