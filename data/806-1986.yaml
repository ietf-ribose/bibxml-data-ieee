  content: To aid identification of components and systems in fossil-fueled power
    plants and related facilities descriptions of systems, structures and components
    are presented. These recommended practices provide a common language of communication
    that will permit the user to correlate a system, structure or component with another
    organization for the purposes of reporting, comparison or general communication.<<ETX>>
