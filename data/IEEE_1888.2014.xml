    <abstract>The standard identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data storage for archiving and developing data sharing platforms, and application units as important system components for developing digital communities, i.e., building-scale and city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure. The standard defines a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways, storage, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks. This enables integration of multiple facilities, data storage, application services such as central management, energy saving, environmental monitoring, and alarm notification systems.</abstract>
