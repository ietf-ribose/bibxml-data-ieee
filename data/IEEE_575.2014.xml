    <abstract>The most common shield/sheath-bonding systems now in use on medium through extra high-voltage (5 kV to 500 kV) single-conductor shielded power cables and the methods of calculating the corresponding shield/sheath voltages and currents, when the cables are operated as part of a three-phase system, with the neutral grounded directly or through an impedance, are described in this guide.</abstract>
