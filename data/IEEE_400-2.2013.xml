    <abstract>Very low frequency (VLF) withstand and other diagnostic tests and measurements that are performed using VLF energization in the field on shielded power cable systems are described in this guide. Whenever possible, cable systems are treated in a similar manner to individual cables. Tables are included as an aid to identifying the effectiveness of the VLF ac voltage test for various cable system insulation problems.</abstract>
