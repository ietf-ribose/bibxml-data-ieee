    <abstract>Uniform methods of measurement of radio noise emitted from low-voltage electrical and electronic equipment, including digital and other information technology equipment, in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz are set forth. Both unintentional and certain intentional radiators are included. Methods for the measurement of radiated and powerline conducted radio noise are covered and may be applied to any such equipment unless otherwise specified by individual equipment requirements.</abstract>
