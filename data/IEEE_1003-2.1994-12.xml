    <abstract>The Portable Applications Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society carried out a series of analyses of various problems encountered by users of IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, IEEE Standard for Information Technology-Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)-Part 2: Shell and Utilities. The results of its deliberations are presented in this document. The intent is to give the POSIX community reasonable ways of interpreting unclear portions of the standard.</abstract>
