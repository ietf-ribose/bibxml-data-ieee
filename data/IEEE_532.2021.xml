    <abstract>Properties of commonly used jackets, as well as selection and testing of jackets, are covered in this guide. It is written for those responsible for optimizing cable designs. The purpose is to present a reasonably complete picture of the role of jackets so that the subject can be approached in an orderly and organized manner. An effort has been made to avoid the highly technical language and theory commonly used by electrical engineers and chemists to discuss the more detailed application of jackets.</abstract>
