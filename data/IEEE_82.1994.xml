    <abstract>A test procedure for impulse testing of insulated conductors (cables) and cables with accessories installed (cable systems) is provided. This procedure can be used as a design or qualification test for cables or for cable systems. This test procedure is not intended to replace any existing or future standards covering cable or cable accessories, impulse generators, impulse testing or voltage measurements. It is intended to supplement such standards by indicating specific procedures for a specific type of cable system or cable system component.</abstract>
