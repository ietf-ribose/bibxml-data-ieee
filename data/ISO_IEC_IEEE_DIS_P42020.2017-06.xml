    <abstract>This document complements the architecture-related processes identified in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and ISO 15704 with activities and tasks that enable architects and others to more effectively and efficiently implement architecture practices. Implementing these practices will help ensure that the architecture has greater influence on business and mission success. It specifies a coherent set of processes for governance, management, conceptualization, evaluation and elaboration of architectures, and activities that enable these processes. Users of this standard can apply these processes in the context of: (1) understanding, development and evolution of entities through their life cycle stages such as conception, development, implementation, operation, sustainment, decommissioning, and disposal; (2) organization(s) acting as users, customers and providers of the solution specified by the architecture description; and (3) architecting of entities.</abstract>
