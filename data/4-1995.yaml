abstract:
  content: This standard establishes standard methods to measure high-voltage and
    basic testing techniques, so far as they are generally applicable, to all types
    of apparatus for alternating voltages, direct voltages, lightning impulse voltags,
    switching impulse voltages, and impulse currents. This revision implements many
    new procedures to improve accuracy, provide greater flexibility, and address practical
    problems associated with high-voltage measurements.
