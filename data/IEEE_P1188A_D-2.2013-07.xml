    <abstract>The amendment will not include a separate Scope clause and the existing scope of IEEE 1188 will not change. The scope of the amendment is to remove the glossary annex and to export terms under the definition clause. The amendment will also introduce a new annex to cover capacity loss in VLRA batteries and will include some minor word changes to provide clarification to the user of the standard.</abstract>
