    <abstract>This guide describes transformer connections and configurations in three-phase electrical systems. The characteristics of the various transformer connections and possible operating problems under normal or abnormal conditions are treated. All combinations of delta and wye, grounded and ungrounded, T-connected, zigzag, and certain special connections are considered. Only two-winding and auto-transformers are included.</abstract>
