    <abstract>This standard describes the service conditions, classifications and voltage ratings, design tests with corresponding performance characteristics, conformance tests, and certification test procedures for station, intermediate, distribution and secondary class arresters. Terminal connections, housing leakage distance, mounting and identification requirements are defined. Definitions are provided to clarify the required test procedures and other portions of the text.</abstract>
