    <abstract>Guidelines for establishing criteria for application, performance, interchangeability, tests, life cycle costs, and safety requirements of traction power rectifier transformers are established in this standard. Set forth are the electrical, mechanical and thermal design, manufacturing, and testing requirements for traction power rectifier transformers for dc electrification systems. Covered in this standard are liquid-immersed and dry-type transformers, including those with cast coil and epoxy resin encapsulated windings.</abstract>
