    <abstract>This standard covers enclosed low-voltage ac power circuit breakers of the stationary or drawout type of two-, three-, or four-pole construction, with one or more rated maximum voltages of 635 V (600 V for units incorporating fuses), 508 V, and 254 V for application on systems having nominal voltages of 600 V, 480 V, and 240 V; unfused or fused circuit breakers; manually or power operated; and with or without electromechanical or electronic trip devices. It deals with service conditions, ratings, functional components, temperature limitations and classifications of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application</abstract>
