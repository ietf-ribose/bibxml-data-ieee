abstract:
  content: 'SUPERSEDED BY ISO/IEC 8802-11:1999 The medium access control and physical
    characteristics for wireless local area networks are specified in this standard,
    part of a series of standards for local and metropolitan area networks. The medium
    access control unit in this standard is designed to support physical layer units
    as they may be adopted dependent on the availability of spectrum. This standard
    contains three physical layer units: two radio units, both operating in the 2400-2500
    MHz band, and one baseband infrared unit. One radio unit employs the frequency-hopping
    spread spectrum technique, and the other employs the direct sequence spread spectrum
    technique.'
