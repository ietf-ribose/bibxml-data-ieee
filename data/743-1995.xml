    <abstract>Performance requirements for test equipment that measures the analog transmission parameters of subscriber loops, message trunks, PBX trunks, and ties lines are specified. Requirements for these measurements with DS1 bit stream access are also provided. The measurement of loss, noise, and impulse noise on non-loaded cable pairs used for digital subscriber lines is also addressed.</abstract>
