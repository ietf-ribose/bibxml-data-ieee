    <abstract>This recommended practice covers the grounding and bonding of equipment in industrial and commercial power systems. The interconnection and grounding of the non electrical metallic elements of a system is covered first. This is followed by a discussion of the objectives of equipment grounding, including minimizing electric shock hazard to personnel, providing adequate current carrying capability for ground faults, and ensuring the timely operation of overcurrent protection.</abstract>
