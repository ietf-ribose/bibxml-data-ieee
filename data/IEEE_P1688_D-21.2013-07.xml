    <abstract>This standard is for use in the specification of electromagnetic performance requirements for Replaceable Electronic Modules (REMs). This standard is suitable for items that have the following features: removable/replaceable electronic circuit modules that plug into an equipment rack or frame, with electrical interconnections primarily through edge connectors that interfaces directly with a backplane, and electrical power input derived from the backplane power sources. This standard is based on MIL-STD-461 System/Equipment level EMI controls. The conducted and radiated requirements, limits and test methods were adapted to provide risk reduction of REM EMI before integration in a system/equipment.</abstract>
