    <abstract>Capacitors and assemblies of capacitors, insulation means, switching, protective equipment, and control accessories that form a complete bank for inserting in series with a transmission line are applied. Included are requirements for safety, rating, and protective device levels. Functional requirements for alarm devices, maintenance, design and production tests, and a guide for operation are included. Functional requirements for protective devices are addressed, including varistors and bypass gaps.</abstract>
