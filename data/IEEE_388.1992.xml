    <abstract>Transformers and inductors of both the saturating and non-saturating type are covered. The power transfer capability of the transformers and inductors covered ranges from less than 1 W to the multi-kilowatt level. The purpose is to provide a common basis between the engineers designing power conversion circuits and the engineers designing the transformers and inductors used in those circuits. Apparatus used in equipment for high-voltage power conversion for distribution by electric utilities is not covered.</abstract>
