    <abstract>The scope of this document is as follows:<br> This guide applies to the use of 50 and 60 Hz shunt power capacitors rated 2400 Vac and above, and assemblies of capacitors. Included are guidelines for the application, protection, and ratings of equipment for the safe and reliable utilization of shunt power capacitors. The guide is general and intended to be basic and supplemental to specific recommendations of the manufacturer. The guide covers applications that range from simple unit utilization to complex bank situations.</br></abstract>
