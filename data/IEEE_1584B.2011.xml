    <abstract>Techniques for designers and facility operators to apply in determining the arc-flash hazard distance and the incident energy to which employees could be exposed during their work on or near electrical equipment are provided in IEEE Std 1584-2002 and IEEE Std 1584a-2004. Changes in Clause 4 (the analysis process), based on the experience of persons who have conducted many of these studies, are provided in this amendment.</abstract>
