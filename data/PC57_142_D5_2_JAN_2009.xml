    <abstract>This Guide addresses the application of transformers in the presence of oscillatory switching transients. These oscillatory transients are typically produced by the interaction of the switching device, transformer, load, and system. This Guide defines operating conditions that may produce switching voltages damaging to the transformer insulation system. It discusses the electrical characteristics of the system source, switching device, transformer, and load and the nature of their transient interaction. It outlines several mitigation methods. Two examples are included.</abstract>
