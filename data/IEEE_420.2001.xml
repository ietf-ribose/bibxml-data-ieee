    <abstract>This standard specifies the design requirements for new and/or modified Class 1E control boards, panels, and racks and establishes the methods to verify that these requirements have been satisfied. Methods for meeting the separation criteria contained in ANSI/IEEE Std 384-1992 are addressed. Qualification is also included to address the overall requirements of ANSI/IEEE Std 323-1983 and ANSI/IEEE Std 344-1987.</abstract>
