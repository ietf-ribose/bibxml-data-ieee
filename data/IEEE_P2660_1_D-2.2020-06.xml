    <abstract>The recommended practices to solve the interface problem when applying industrial agents, namely, integrating intelligent software agents with low-level automation devices in the context of cyber-physical systems, are described in this recommended practice. In particular, a method to select the best interfacing practice for a given application scenario, defined by the user, from a set of available interfacing templates and technologies, aiming to improve reuse, consistency, and transparency in the integration of industrial agents and low-level control functions, is defined.</abstract>
