    <abstract>Recommendations are given for reactors intended for series connection, in both transmission and distribution systems, to control power flow under steady-state conditions and/or limit fault current under short-circuit conditions. Dry-type air-core reactors covered by this standard are self-cooled by natural air convection. With some restrictions, other reactors, including filter reactors, shunt capacitor reactors (used with shunt capacitor banks), and discharge current-limiting reactors (used with series capacitor banks) are also covered.</abstract>
