    <abstract>Practical methods for making electroacoustic laboratory measurements of analog and digital speech communications terminals and connected audio devices are contained in this standard. The methods are applicable to a wide variety of wired, wireless, cordless, and mobile communication terminals. Examples include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Wi-Fi®, and softphone devices. Tests applicable to connected audio devices such as wired, Bluetooth®, and universal serial bus (USB) handsets, headsets, and wearables are included. The standard contains objective metrics, subjective metrics, and subjective metric predictors. Application is in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.</abstract>
