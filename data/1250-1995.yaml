abstract:
  content: Computers, computer-like products, and equipment using solid-state power
    conversion have created entirely new areas of power quality considerations. There
    is an increasing awareness that much of this new user equipment is not designed
    to withstand the surges, faults, and reclosing duty present on typical distribution
    systems. Momentary voltage disturbances occuring in AC power distribution and
    utilization systems, their potential effects on this new, sensitive, user equipment,
    and guidance toward mitigation of these effects are described. Harmonic distortion
    limits are also discussed.<<ETX>>
