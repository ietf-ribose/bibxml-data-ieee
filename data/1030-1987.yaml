abstract:
  content: The report provides general guidance on the steady-state performance requirements
    of high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) systems. It concerns the steady-state performance
    of two-terminal HVDC systems utilizing 12 pulse converter units consisting of
    three-phase bridge (double way) connections. Excluded are multi-terminal HVDC
    transmission systems. Both converters are assumed to use thyristor valves as the
    main semiconductor valves and to have power flow capability in both directions.
    No consideration is given to diode valves.<<ETX>>
