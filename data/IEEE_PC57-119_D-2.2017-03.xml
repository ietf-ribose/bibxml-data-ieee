    <abstract>Recommendations are made, where possible, regarding the performance and evaluation of temperature rise tests on liquid-immersed power transformers beyond nameplate ratings in this recommended practice. The intent is to assist power transformer manufacturers, and the ultimate users, in evaluating thermal performance of the transformers under varying loads.</abstract>
