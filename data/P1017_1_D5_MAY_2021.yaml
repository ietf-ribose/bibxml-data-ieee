abstract:
  content: Procedures and test voltage values for factory, acceptance and maintenance
    testing of electric submersible pump (ESP) cable systems are presented. This recommended
    practice applies to cable systems rated 3 kV through 8 kV (phase to phase) and
    is intended only for this special-purpose cable. The intent is to provide uniform
    test procedures and guidelines for evaluation of the test results.
