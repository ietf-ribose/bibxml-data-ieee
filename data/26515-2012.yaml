abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 26515:2012 specifies the way in which user documentation can
    be developed in agile development projects. It is intended for use in all organizations
    that are using agile development, or are considering implementing their projects
    using these techniques. It applies to people or organizations producing suites
    of documentation, to those undertaking a single documentation project, and to
    documentation produced internally, as well as to documentation contracted to outside
    service organizations. ISO/IEC/IEEE 26515:2012 addresses the relationship between
    the user documentation process and the life cycle documentation process in agile
    development. It describes how the information developer or project manager may
    plan and manage the user documentation development in an agile environment. It
    is intended neither to encourage nor to discourage the use of any particular agile
    development tools or methods.
