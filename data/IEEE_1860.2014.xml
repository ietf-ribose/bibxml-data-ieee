    <abstract>This guide applies to voltage and reactive power control in 1000 kV and above ac systems. It establishes criteria and requirements for electric power utilities in the planning, design, infrastructure, operation, and scientific research of voltage or reactive power in 1000 kV and above ac systems, which should guarantee the system stability and equipment safety.</abstract>
