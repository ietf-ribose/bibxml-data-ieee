    <abstract>The specific test requirements for qualifying electrical resistance heating cables for industrial service are provided, as well as the basis for electrical and thermal design. Heating device characteristics are addressed, and installation and maintenance requirements are detailed. Heating cable and surface heating device application recommendations and requirements are made for ordinary (unclassified) and hazardous (classified) potentially flammable atmospheres and locations.</abstract>
