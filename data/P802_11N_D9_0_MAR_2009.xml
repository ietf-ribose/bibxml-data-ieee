    <abstract>This amendment defines modifications to both the 802.11 physical layers (PHY) and the 802.11 Medium Access Control Layer (MAC) so that modes of operation can be enabled that are capable of much higher throughputs, with a maximum throughput of at least 100 Mb/s, as measured at the MAC data service access point (SAP).</abstract>
