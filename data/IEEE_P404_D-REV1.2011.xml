    <abstract>Electrical ratings and test requirements of cable joints used with extruded andlaminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 2.5 kV to 500 kV areestablished in this standard. In addition, test requirements for joint metallic shield and jacketingcomponents are defined. A variety of common joint constructions are also defined. This standardhas been designed to provide uniform testing procedures that can be used by manufacturers andusers to evaluate the ability of underground power cable joints, and associated metallic shieldsand jacketing components, to perform reliably in service.</abstract>
