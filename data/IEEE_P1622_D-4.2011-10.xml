    <abstract>This standard specifies electronic data interchange formats for blank ballot distribution, primarily to assist in satisfying the needs of the UOCAVA (Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) and MOVE (Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment) Acts. Subsequent standards will address other requirements for electronic data interchange formats used by components of voting systems for exchange of electronic data. This scope does not include return of cast ballots by electronic means. The P1622 Voting Equipment Electronic Data Interchange Committee produces this standard.</abstract>
