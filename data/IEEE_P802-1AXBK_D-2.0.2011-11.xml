    <abstract>Link Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a Link Aggregation Group, such that a Media Access Control (MAC) Client can treat the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links, consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent Link Aggregation capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support Link Aggregation.</abstract>
