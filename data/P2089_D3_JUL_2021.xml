  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">The standard establishes a set of processes by which organizations seek to make their services Age Appropriate. The standard is to support the growing desire of organisations to design digital products and services with children in mind and reflects their existing rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention). While different jurisdictions may have different laws and regulations in place, this standard offers best practice for designing digital services that impact directly or indirectly on children. It sets out processes through the life cycle of development, delivery and distribution, that will help organizations ask the right relevant questions of their services, identify risks and opportunities by which to make their services age appropriate and take steps to mitigate risk and embed beneficial systems that support increased age appropriate engagement. One in three users online is under 18, which means that this standard has wide application. The age of adulthood is determined by article 1 in the Convention of the Rights of the Child.</abstract>
