    <abstract>Information on the specification and selection of power, control, and special-purpose cable, as typically used in petroleum, chemical, and similar plants, is provided in this guide. Materials, design, testing, and applications are addressed. More recent developments, such as strand filling, low smoke, zero-halogen materials, chemical-moisture barriers, and fire-resistive cables have been included.</abstract>
