    <abstract>The operation, functions, and attributes of a parallel system bus (PSB), called MULTIBUS II, are defined. A high- performance backplane bus intended for use in multiple-microprocessor systems, the PSB incorporates synchronous, 32-bit multiplexed address/data, with error detection, and uses a 10 MHz bus clock. This design is intended to provide reliable state- of-the-art operation and to allow the implementation of cost-effective high-performance VLSI for the bus interface. Memory, I/O, message, and geographic address spaces are defined. Error detection and retry is provided for messages. The message-passing design allows a VLSI implementation, so that virtually all modules on the bus will utilize the bus at its highest performance32 to 40 Mbyte/s. An overview of PSB, signal descriptions, the PSB protocol, electrical characteristics, and mechanical specifications are covered. This document also contains IEEE Std 1101-1987, IEEE Standard for Mechanical Core Specifications for Microcomputers.</abstract>
