    <abstract>Export data related to motor vehicle pre-defined events in usage history is collected, recorded, stored, and exported by motor vehicle event data recorders (MVEDRs). A protocol for MVEDR output data compatibility and export protocols of MVEDR data elements is defined by this standard. A motor vehicle event data recorder connector lockout apparatus (MVEDRCLA) and a near field communication (NFC) protocol is defined for safeguarding access to a vehicleâ€™s event data recorder (EDR) data by securing the vehicle output diagnostic link connector (DLC) and establishing a chain of custody link. This standard is without prejudice to requirements of national or regional laws related to privacy, data protection, and personal data processing.</abstract>
