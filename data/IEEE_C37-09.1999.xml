    <abstract>The testing procedures for all high-voltage circuit breakers that include all voltage ratings above 1000 V ac and comprise both indoor and outdoor types having the preferred ratings as listed in ANSI C37.06-1997 are covered. Typical circuit breakers covered by these standards have maximum voltage ratings from 4.76 kV through 800 kV, and continuous current ratings of 600 A, 1200 A, 2000 A, and 3000 A associated with the various maximum voltage ratings. The test procedures verify all assigned ratings, including continuous current, dielectric withstand voltages, short-circuit current, transient recovery voltage, and capacitor switching, plus associated capabilities such as mechanical endurance, load current, and out-of-phase switching. Production test procedures are also included. This standard does not cover generator circuit breakers as these are covered in IEEE Std C37.013-1993.</abstract>
